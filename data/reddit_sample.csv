2025-06-24 09:25:08,Is it true that Arabs in Israel are treated as second class citizens or are they treated as equals?,"I will try to provide a comprehensive answer.



**1. Non-Jews Israelis are not equal to Jews in Israel.**

**2. Yet, Arab Israelis have a higher standard of living than Arabs or Jews in many Arab countries.**

They have access to universities, hospitals, and high grade jobs. They benefit from a system that is more developed than in Arab countries. Women rights also are more defended than in other Arab countries.

  
**3. In any case, the benefits some Arabs might get under the Israeli system do not morally and legally shade away the crimes of an apartheid state.**

Israel is committing colonization, oppression, and apartheid on non-Israeli Palestinians. The benefits the state might provide to some Arabs do not acquit it from its crimes.

2025-06-23 13:12:29,This subreddit has a clear pro-Israeli bias,"But the OP apparently supports destruction of Israel. OP is upset that Iran was prevented to destroy Israel with its nukes.

Yes, State of Israel has the right to exist (=has the right not to be destroyed), but ""State of Palestine"" simply does not exist, and never did.

No, the land of Palestine never belonged to any particular group living there, it is simply not true (at least not since Province of Judea was destroyed by Romans in 135AD). It was part of Ottoman Empire when Zionism started, and then it was under control of Great Britain (who in fact got its mandate from League of Nations to govern Palestine in order to establish a national home for Jews...). Also, Zionism is not about control over the whole region of Palestine but rather about establishing a national home for Jews in Palestine. Too much discrepancy about facts here :)","If you’ve spent any real time on r/IsraelPalestine, it becomes painfully obvious that the subreddit isn’t actually a neutral space for discussion, it’s a curated stage for a very particular narrative: one that consistently bends toward excusing Zionism, obscuring Palestinian resistance, and laundering Israeli state violence through the language of security, diplomacy, and ""peace.""

At the heart of this is a deep, unspoken bias: Zionism is normalized, even celebrated, while any organized Palestinian or regional response to Zionism is pathologized. The state of Israel, founded through mass displacement and continued military domination, is treated as a given, a nation with existential needs, security concerns, and legitimacy. But when Palestinians resist, whether violently, politically, or through civil disobedience it’s always framed as extremism, terrorism, or refusal to compromise. This framing is not accidental. It’s baked into the logic of the subreddit itself: what kind of speech is upvoted, which voices are platformed, and what types of suffering are seen as “context” rather than central facts.

One of the most frustrating dynamics is the subreddit’s liberal Zionist consensus, a worldview that claims to oppose occupation, but only in theory, only if it doesn’t involve seriously interrogating Jewish supremacy as embedded in Israeli law and policy. These users cling to the fantasy of a “two-state solution” long after even Israeli leaders have discarded it. They offer words of peace, but only if Palestinians accept fragmentation, limited autonomy, and no meaningful return. They’ll express sadness over bombings in Gaza but still frame every war as something “Hamas started.”

What this group often refuses to understand is how, for many Palestinians, and for a surprising number of secular Arabs and Iranians too, groups like Hamas or the IRGC aren't just caricatures of Islamist authoritarianism. They’re seen as responses to something even more suffocating: occupation, siege, bombardment, and decades of Western-backed dispossession. You don’t have to agree with these groups’ ideologies to understand why people who have watched Israeli bombs level their cities, or who live under constant threat of regime change (Reza Pahlavi, the disgraced son of their former corrupt monarch is literally being floated as one of the more likely successors to the regime by the Israeli government) , might view them as defense, as dignity, as something, when the world offers them nothing.

This is especially true in moments of Israeli escalation. When Israeli warplanes flatten residential towers in Gaza, when Israeli politicians openly speak about wiping out “human animals,” when sanctions suffocate Iranian hospitals while foreign powers openly call for “regime change” in Tehran or Damascus—it should be no surprise that even secular citizens, people who might oppose clericalism or militant rhetoric in other contexts, find themselves aligning with resistance factions. Because when your options are annihilation or flawed resistance, survival usually doesn’t ask for ideological purity.

Take, for example, the **r**ecent US airstrike of Iran's nuclear facilities, an act of aggression that, like Israeli airstrikes on Gaza, was framed as a **necessary measure of security**. But in what right does Israel, or the U.S., for that matter have to dictate whether Iran can or cannot pursue nuclear weapons? The logic used to justify these actions is essentially the same logic that’s used to frame **Israeli occupation** and **bombing campaigns** in Palestine: it's about **defending the West** and **securing regional stability**, even if that means **extending occupation** and **worsening humanitarian crises**.

What is often left out of the equation is that the U.S. and Israel have **repeatedly been the aggressors** in the region. **Israel’s nuclear weapons program** is not only **unacknowledged** by the international community but also **never subject to the same scrutiny** Iran faces, even though Israel maintains **a significant nuclear arsenal** and has used its military to **target neighboring countries**. The **U.S.** is equally guilty of such hypocrisy. For decades, it has **interfered in the region**—whether through direct military intervention or by supporting **authoritarian regimes** that maintain order at the expense of the people.

And yet, when it comes to Iran seeking nuclear capabilities, both the U.S. and Israel cast themselves as the **global arbiters of what is and isn’t acceptable** in terms of weapons development. **The double standard is glaring**. While these powers have **militarized the region**, **propped up despotic regimes**, and **launched devastating airstrikes**, they’re now positioning themselves as the defenders of peace and stability, telling Iran what it can and cannot do. It’s like a thief telling a neighbor not to lock their door while they’ve been robbing houses down the street for years.

This is part of a larger Western imperial project that the subreddit often fails to interrogate. When the U.S. bombs Iran, imposes crippling sanctions on its population, and supports the Israeli military’s daily violence, it’s framed as an exceptional and justified act, necessary for peace and security, despite the fact that these same actions destabilize entire countries and perpetuate cycles of violence. Yet, when Palestinians push back, whether through armed resistance or nonviolent protests, the rhetoric shifts to terrorism and rejectionism.

But here's where the real distortion occurs on r/IsraelPalestine: the reduction of Israeli violence to Netanyahu’s policies. This narrative seeks to isolate the problem to one individual—Benjamin Netanyahu—while glossing over the larger, deeply embedded support for Zionism and Israel's policies within Israeli society. Netanyahu is not the sole actor in this; he represents a wider consensus among many Israelis who actively support the policies of military occupation, apartheid, and ethnic cleansing. This isn't just the rhetoric of one government official—it’s the reality of Israeli state policy, supported by a large section of the Israeli public. To keep framing the issue as simply Netanyahu’s fault is to ignore the structural violence of a state that has existed for over seven decades with its policies largely supported by the Israeli electorate.

Further, a lot of Israelis here (especially ""peaceniks"") regurgitate the narrative that Palestinian citizens of Israel (those who remained after the 1948 Nakba) are somehow the “proof” that Israel isn’t an apartheid state is deeply misleading. The fact that Palestinians living in Israel are used as a cover, a shield to deflect accusations of apartheid, is a hilarious obfuscation of reality. These Palestinians, while technically citizens, remain second-class citizens with no real equality in housing, education, land access, political power, or resources. They live under discriminatory laws that prevent them from accessing many of the same opportunities as Jewish Israelis. They are subject to surveillance, systemic oppression, and are often treated as suspect citizens in their own homeland, particularly when they protest or speak out for Palestinian rights. Claiming that Israel isn't an apartheid state because of this minority group’s legal status ignores the profound inequalities that exist, and, frankly, smacks of a deliberate attempt to shield Israel from valid international criticism.

And yet, on r/IsraelPalestine, this complexity is erased. People speak of “terrorism” without asking what produced it. They invoke atrocities without acknowledging the structures that created the desperation behind them. And they constantly weaponize Jewish historical trauma as a shield for contemporary colonial policy, shutting down critique by collapsing Zionism with Judaism in ways that silence even anti-Zionist Jews.

Let’s be clear: the subreddit does not treat history with any kind of balance. The Nakba is a footnote; the Sabra and Shatila massacre is ignored; the siege of Gaza is abstracted into rocket statistics. But bring up any act of resistance, and the moral clarity becomes blinding. “They started it.” “They rejected peace.” “They hate Jews.” The same users who will tell you the occupation is “complex” and “multifaceted” will reduce the entire Palestinian national movement to antisemitism or religious fanaticism.

And beyond Palestinians, there’s a consistent erasure of how Israeli policy has brutalized the broader region—bombings in Syria and Lebanon, assassinations in Iran, the destabilization of Egypt, and the indirect role Israel played in supporting authoritarian regimes favorable to Western policy. When people from these countries raise grievances, the response is always the same: whataboutism, deflection, and an insistence that any suffering caused by Israel is either exaggerated or deserved.

The underlying message is clear: some lives require context, others are just collateral.

If r/IsraelPalestine wanted to be a genuine forum for difficult, uncomfortable conversations, it would have to do much more than ban slurs and lock threads. It would have to question its own foundations: why Zionism is treated as a legitimate national movement, while Palestinian nationalism is treated as a pathology. Why liberal Zionist fantasies of peace are treated as pragmatism, while Palestinian demands for equality and return are labeled as rejectionism. Why those resisting a siege are constantly asked to justify themselves, while the siege itself is accepted as the natural order of things.

Until that happens, r/IsraelPalestine isn’t a discussion space. It’s just a digital checkpoint—policing what kinds of grief are legitimate, and what kinds of resistance are allowed to exist. I am sure this will get downvoted to oblivion but if you're still a Zionist in the big 25' I doubt anything I say could change your mind",1,Motek2,"This subreddit has a clear pro-Israeli bias If you’ve spent any real time on r/IsraelPalestine, it becomes painfully obvious that the subreddit isn’t actually a neutral space for discussion, it’s a curated stage for a very particular narrative: one that consistently bends toward excusing Zionism, obscuring Palestinian resistance, and laundering Israeli state violence through the language of security, diplomacy, and ""peace.""

2025-06-24 18:43:34,Military Victory Against Israel,"What do you think standoff weapons mean? are you expecting gun runs? combat footage is full of targeting pod footage of Israel hitting missile launchers and air defense, the pods themselves can only target some +-30km, which means they were deep inside Iran.","Now that the ceasefire between Israel and Iran has gone into effect, I think it is extremely important for the community to discuss a few topics about this conflict.

Based on my historical understanding, Iran's is the first clear conventional military victory of a nation against Israel. 1948 and 1967 were clear victories for Israel. While Egypt made significant early victories in the 1973 war, Israel was eventually able to push the Egyptians back, so while the conflict may have been a symbolic victory for Egypt it was not a military victory. My understanding is that the current Israeli-Iranian War was a victory for Iran is based on the following reasons:

1. Israel suffered massive damage to its infrastructure, including in Tel Aviv, Haifa, and other areas. As far as I understand, this is the first time that this has occurred in Israel's history.

2. As the conflict developed, Israel was not able to make significant progress on any of its military goals, summarized as follows: 

a) While it did cause damage to a number of Iran's nuclear facilities, it is not clear what if any significant damage was done to Iran's nuclear program overall. Israel was able to kill a number of Iran's nuclear scientists as well as top military leaders, so they did achieve this goal. 

b) It is not clear to me that Israel was able to significantly harm any of Iran's military capabilities. 

c) Israel was not able to achieve regime change in Iran, and to the contrary appears to have unified the country behind the Iranian government more than it has been in decades. 

Ultimately I believe that the ceasefire was proposed and enforced because the US (aka President Trump) understood that continuing the conflict would further destroy Israel's infrastructure without significant chance of achieving any of the above military aims. In other words, the US finally had to accept that continuing the conflict would only serve to militarily benefit Iran, physically harm Israel, and harm the US and President Trump's reputation. In other words, Iran clearly won the conflict. 

Furthermore, it is important to consider that Iran was able to achieve this historical military victory against Israel in spite of the following:

1. Israel's military technology and funding that it receives from the United States. This was supposed to be a massive advantage for Israel. It had amassed tens of billions of dollars of weapons and technology from the US, including the Iron Dome, many cutting edge F35 fighter planes, ballistic missiles, etc. 

2. Military intelligence and defensive support from the United States

3. No major state allies assisting Iran in the Middle East. In fact, a number of Sunni countries were actively working to support Israel (Jordan and Saudi providing intelligence to Israel and helping to spot and/or shoot down Iranian drones and missiles, Turkey continuing to supply Azeri oil to Israel).",1,Terrible_Duty_7643,"Military Victory Against Israel Now that the ceasefire between Israel and Iran has gone into effect, I think it is extremely important for the community to discuss a few topics about this conflict.

Then, I see the footage that HAMAS filmed themselves in the kibbutzim. I see the carnage, the depravity, the kidnapping of Noa Argamani, the family held hostage in their home by Hamasniks with rifles, children in pools of their parents’ blood. I see all this, because HAMAS filmed themselves doing it, uploaded it. They were proud of this slaughter.  
  
Then next, I see the Times Square demonstration. Here's where I want to engage your imagination. Let’s imagine together what *could* have happened and maybe *should* have happened in the West.

Maybe these organizers say something like, “What happened yesterday does not reflect our movement. We believe in resistance but there is a line, and yesterday that line was crossed. We urge the international community to intervene on behalf of Gazan civilians so that they don’t become collateral in this war that HAMAS has provoked.” Or you know, something along those lines.  
  
Maybe we see banners saying, “**Peace now, justice now, for Palestine and Israel!”** or “**Two peoples, one land, one future for us all.”** (I don’t know, maybe y’all could have come up with something better, this is just what I could find on Google.)  
  
Maybe we see the International Community take responsibility for the role it played in allowing 10/7 to play out. Instead of condemning the response before it even begins (remember, we’re talking 10/8 here) or saying that Israel brought this on itself, maybe the International Community agrees that regardless of preceding events, some things are objectively wrong and must be condemned, and that the UN will do its part in advocating for the hostages’ release, as well as mitigating collateral damage against Gazan civilians (possibly through an evacuation).

  
Maybe the Red Cross *insists* on being allowed to see the hostages, instead of sitting on its hands the entire time. Maybe the Red Cross could say something like, “We acknowledge that we allowed Jewish suffering during the Shoah, that we were more than complicit, that we actively participated in its cover-up, and we want to rectify that today by demanding the immediate and unconditional release of all Israeli hostages presently held in Gaza” or something to that effect.

Again, I can send you the original footage posted on X, but they’re pretty clear in Tal’s videos below.

I added interviews from people in Gaza, a few videos of the people revolting against Hamas, screaming “Fuck Hamas!” In Arabic (you can run through a translator to confirm the subtitles), and videos of people being shot at by Hamas when trying to obtain foreign aid stolen from the people. I think I even added a link of Hamas stealing aid (if I didn’t, let me know and I’ll send it).

But most of all, I wanted to show you the footage of the people showing their love of Israel and the US, not just the videos of their hate for Hamas.

2025-06-23 13:12:29,This subreddit has a clear pro-Israeli bias,"I didn't insult anyone. I'm just pointing out that they're not defending anything or anyone, and so I refuse to call them by that name. Some of your Zionist buddies on here refuse to even call Palestinians what they are, and you take offence to ""IOF""?","If you’ve spent any real time on r/IsraelPalestine, it becomes painfully obvious that the subreddit isn’t actually a neutral space for discussion, it’s a curated stage for a very particular narrative: one that consistently bends toward excusing Zionism, obscuring Palestinian resistance, and laundering Israeli state violence through the language of security, diplomacy, and ""peace.""

At the heart of this is a deep, unspoken bias: Zionism is normalized, even celebrated, while any organized Palestinian or regional response to Zionism is pathologized. The state of Israel, founded through mass displacement and continued military domination, is treated as a given, a nation with existential needs, security concerns, and legitimacy. But when Palestinians resist, whether violently, politically, or through civil disobedience it’s always framed as extremism, terrorism, or refusal to compromise. This framing is not accidental. It’s baked into the logic of the subreddit itself: what kind of speech is upvoted, which voices are platformed, and what types of suffering are seen as “context” rather than central facts.

One of the most frustrating dynamics is the subreddit’s liberal Zionist consensus, a worldview that claims to oppose occupation, but only in theory, only if it doesn’t involve seriously interrogating Jewish supremacy as embedded in Israeli law and policy. These users cling to the fantasy of a “two-state solution” long after even Israeli leaders have discarded it. They offer words of peace, but only if Palestinians accept fragmentation, limited autonomy, and no meaningful return. They’ll express sadness over bombings in Gaza but still frame every war as something “Hamas started.”

What this group often refuses to understand is how, for many Palestinians, and for a surprising number of secular Arabs and Iranians too, groups like Hamas or the IRGC aren't just caricatures of Islamist authoritarianism. They’re seen as responses to something even more suffocating: occupation, siege, bombardment, and decades of Western-backed dispossession. You don’t have to agree with these groups’ ideologies to understand why people who have watched Israeli bombs level their cities, or who live under constant threat of regime change (Reza Pahlavi, the disgraced son of their former corrupt monarch is literally being floated as one of the more likely successors to the regime by the Israeli government) , might view them as defense, as dignity, as something, when the world offers them nothing.

This is especially true in moments of Israeli escalation. When Israeli warplanes flatten residential towers in Gaza, when Israeli politicians openly speak about wiping out “human animals,” when sanctions suffocate Iranian hospitals while foreign powers openly call for “regime change” in Tehran or Damascus—it should be no surprise that even secular citizens, people who might oppose clericalism or militant rhetoric in other contexts, find themselves aligning with resistance factions. Because when your options are annihilation or flawed resistance, survival usually doesn’t ask for ideological purity.

Take, for example, the **r**ecent US airstrike of Iran's nuclear facilities, an act of aggression that, like Israeli airstrikes on Gaza, was framed as a **necessary measure of security**. But in what right does Israel, or the U.S., for that matter have to dictate whether Iran can or cannot pursue nuclear weapons? The logic used to justify these actions is essentially the same logic that’s used to frame **Israeli occupation** and **bombing campaigns** in Palestine: it's about **defending the West** and **securing regional stability**, even if that means **extending occupation** and **worsening humanitarian crises**.

What is often left out of the equation is that the U.S. and Israel have **repeatedly been the aggressors** in the region. **Israel’s nuclear weapons program** is not only **unacknowledged** by the international community but also **never subject to the same scrutiny** Iran faces, even though Israel maintains **a significant nuclear arsenal** and has used its military to **target neighboring countries**. The **U.S.** is equally guilty of such hypocrisy. For decades, it has **interfered in the region**—whether through direct military intervention or by supporting **authoritarian regimes** that maintain order at the expense of the people.

And yet, when it comes to Iran seeking nuclear capabilities, both the U.S. and Israel cast themselves as the **global arbiters of what is and isn’t acceptable** in terms of weapons development. **The double standard is glaring**. While these powers have **militarized the region**, **propped up despotic regimes**, and **launched devastating airstrikes**, they’re now positioning themselves as the defenders of peace and stability, telling Iran what it can and cannot do. It’s like a thief telling a neighbor not to lock their door while they’ve been robbing houses down the street for years.

This is part of a larger Western imperial project that the subreddit often fails to interrogate. When the U.S. bombs Iran, imposes crippling sanctions on its population, and supports the Israeli military’s daily violence, it’s framed as an exceptional and justified act, necessary for peace and security, despite the fact that these same actions destabilize entire countries and perpetuate cycles of violence. Yet, when Palestinians push back, whether through armed resistance or nonviolent protests, the rhetoric shifts to terrorism and rejectionism.

But here's where the real distortion occurs on r/IsraelPalestine: the reduction of Israeli violence to Netanyahu’s policies. This narrative seeks to isolate the problem to one individual—Benjamin Netanyahu—while glossing over the larger, deeply embedded support for Zionism and Israel's policies within Israeli society. Netanyahu is not the sole actor in this; he represents a wider consensus among many Israelis who actively support the policies of military occupation, apartheid, and ethnic cleansing. This isn't just the rhetoric of one government official—it’s the reality of Israeli state policy, supported by a large section of the Israeli public. To keep framing the issue as simply Netanyahu’s fault is to ignore the structural violence of a state that has existed for over seven decades with its policies largely supported by the Israeli electorate.

Further, a lot of Israelis here (especially ""peaceniks"") regurgitate the narrative that Palestinian citizens of Israel (those who remained after the 1948 Nakba) are somehow the “proof” that Israel isn’t an apartheid state is deeply misleading. The fact that Palestinians living in Israel are used as a cover, a shield to deflect accusations of apartheid, is a hilarious obfuscation of reality. These Palestinians, while technically citizens, remain second-class citizens with no real equality in housing, education, land access, political power, or resources. They live under discriminatory laws that prevent them from accessing many of the same opportunities as Jewish Israelis. They are subject to surveillance, systemic oppression, and are often treated as suspect citizens in their own homeland, particularly when they protest or speak out for Palestinian rights. Claiming that Israel isn't an apartheid state because of this minority group’s legal status ignores the profound inequalities that exist, and, frankly, smacks of a deliberate attempt to shield Israel from valid international criticism.

And yet, on r/IsraelPalestine, this complexity is erased. People speak of “terrorism” without asking what produced it. They invoke atrocities without acknowledging the structures that created the desperation behind them. And they constantly weaponize Jewish historical trauma as a shield for contemporary colonial policy, shutting down critique by collapsing Zionism with Judaism in ways that silence even anti-Zionist Jews.

Let’s be clear: the subreddit does not treat history with any kind of balance. The Nakba is a footnote; the Sabra and Shatila massacre is ignored; the siege of Gaza is abstracted into rocket statistics. But bring up any act of resistance, and the moral clarity becomes blinding. “They started it.” “They rejected peace.” “They hate Jews.” The same users who will tell you the occupation is “complex” and “multifaceted” will reduce the entire Palestinian national movement to antisemitism or religious fanaticism.

And beyond Palestinians, there’s a consistent erasure of how Israeli policy has brutalized the broader region—bombings in Syria and Lebanon, assassinations in Iran, the destabilization of Egypt, and the indirect role Israel played in supporting authoritarian regimes favorable to Western policy. When people from these countries raise grievances, the response is always the same: whataboutism, deflection, and an insistence that any suffering caused by Israel is either exaggerated or deserved.

The underlying message is clear: some lives require context, others are just collateral.

If r/IsraelPalestine wanted to be a genuine forum for difficult, uncomfortable conversations, it would have to do much more than ban slurs and lock threads. It would have to question its own foundations: why Zionism is treated as a legitimate national movement, while Palestinian nationalism is treated as a pathology. Why liberal Zionist fantasies of peace are treated as pragmatism, while Palestinian demands for equality and return are labeled as rejectionism. Why those resisting a siege are constantly asked to justify themselves, while the siege itself is accepted as the natural order of things.

Until that happens, r/IsraelPalestine isn’t a discussion space. It’s just a digital checkpoint—policing what kinds of grief are legitimate, and what kinds of resistance are allowed to exist. I am sure this will get downvoted to oblivion but if you're still a Zionist in the big 25' I doubt anything I say could change your mind",1,financeposter,"This subreddit has a clear pro-Israeli bias If you’ve spent any real time on r/IsraelPalestine, it becomes painfully obvious that the subreddit isn’t actually a neutral space for discussion, it’s a curated stage for a very particular narrative: one that consistently bends toward excusing Zionism, obscuring Palestinian resistance, and laundering Israeli state violence through the language of security, diplomacy, and ""peace.""

man there is videos of old jews who are admitting to doing this! there is many news and online videos of your people in Juresalem and around going to Palestinian houses and kicking them our of their houses! and those people are not in Gaza or part of the freaking excuse of yours HAMAS!

Then, I see the footage that HAMAS filmed themselves in the kibbutzim. I see the carnage, the depravity, the kidnapping of Noa Argamani, the family held hostage in their home by Hamasniks with rifles, children in pools of their parents’ blood. I see all this, because HAMAS filmed themselves doing it, uploaded it. They were proud of this slaughter.  
  
Then next, I see the Times Square demonstration. Here's where I want to engage your imagination. Let’s imagine together what *could* have happened and maybe *should* have happened in the West.

Maybe these organizers say something like, “What happened yesterday does not reflect our movement. We believe in resistance but there is a line, and yesterday that line was crossed.

Maybe we see the International Community take responsibility for the role it played in allowing 10/7 to play out. Instead of condemning the response before it even begins (remember, we’re talking 10/8 here) or saying that Israel brought this on itself, maybe the International Community agrees that regardless of preceding events, some things are objectively wrong and must be condemned, and that the UN will do its part in advocating for the hostages’ release, as well as mitigating collateral damage against Gazan civilians (possibly through an evacuation).

  
Maybe the Red Cross *insists* on being allowed to see the hostages, instead of sitting on its hands the entire time. Maybe the Red Cross could say something like, “We acknowledge that we allowed Jewish suffering during the Shoah, that we were more than complicit, that we actively participated in its cover-up, and we want to rectify that today by demanding the immediate and unconditional release of all Israeli hostages presently held in Gaza” or something to that effect.

2025-06-23 13:12:29,This subreddit has a clear pro-Israeli bias,"I never said anything about supporting the destruction of an existing state. What I said was that you accept Israel has the right to exist (after Palestine was partitioned in 1947 to establish Israel), but you don't accept that Palestine does. This is the asymmetry.

They rejected the partition plan because it was originally their land, which was voted to be partitioned. It's like if I took your house and decide to ""partition"" it, giving half to myself, and leaving you the other half, against your will. Of course they're going to reject that, why wouldn't they?

The question of whether Palestinians would have the intention to destroy Israel is a different question entirely. Israelis have not exactly been civil in this regard either, and have always intended to have complete control over the region. Which is what Zionism has always been about in the first place.","If you’ve spent any real time on r/IsraelPalestine, it becomes painfully obvious that the subreddit isn’t actually a neutral space for discussion, it’s a curated stage for a very particular narrative: one that consistently bends toward excusing Zionism, obscuring Palestinian resistance, and laundering Israeli state violence through the language of security, diplomacy, and ""peace.""

At the heart of this is a deep, unspoken bias: Zionism is normalized, even celebrated, while any organized Palestinian or regional response to Zionism is pathologized. The state of Israel, founded through mass displacement and continued military domination, is treated as a given, a nation with existential needs, security concerns, and legitimacy. But when Palestinians resist, whether violently, politically, or through civil disobedience it’s always framed as extremism, terrorism, or refusal to compromise. This framing is not accidental. It’s baked into the logic of the subreddit itself: what kind of speech is upvoted, which voices are platformed, and what types of suffering are seen as “context” rather than central facts.

One of the most frustrating dynamics is the subreddit’s liberal Zionist consensus, a worldview that claims to oppose occupation, but only in theory, only if it doesn’t involve seriously interrogating Jewish supremacy as embedded in Israeli law and policy. These users cling to the fantasy of a “two-state solution” long after even Israeli leaders have discarded it. They offer words of peace, but only if Palestinians accept fragmentation, limited autonomy, and no meaningful return. They’ll express sadness over bombings in Gaza but still frame every war as something “Hamas started.”

What this group often refuses to understand is how, for many Palestinians, and for a surprising number of secular Arabs and Iranians too, groups like Hamas or the IRGC aren't just caricatures of Islamist authoritarianism. They’re seen as responses to something even more suffocating: occupation, siege, bombardment, and decades of Western-backed dispossession. You don’t have to agree with these groups’ ideologies to understand why people who have watched Israeli bombs level their cities, or who live under constant threat of regime change (Reza Pahlavi, the disgraced son of their former corrupt monarch is literally being floated as one of the more likely successors to the regime by the Israeli government) , might view them as defense, as dignity, as something, when the world offers them nothing.

This is especially true in moments of Israeli escalation. When Israeli warplanes flatten residential towers in Gaza, when Israeli politicians openly speak about wiping out “human animals,” when sanctions suffocate Iranian hospitals while foreign powers openly call for “regime change” in Tehran or Damascus—it should be no surprise that even secular citizens, people who might oppose clericalism or militant rhetoric in other contexts, find themselves aligning with resistance factions. Because when your options are annihilation or flawed resistance, survival usually doesn’t ask for ideological purity.

Take, for example, the **r**ecent US airstrike of Iran's nuclear facilities, an act of aggression that, like Israeli airstrikes on Gaza, was framed as a **necessary measure of security**. But in what right does Israel, or the U.S., for that matter have to dictate whether Iran can or cannot pursue nuclear weapons? The logic used to justify these actions is essentially the same logic that’s used to frame **Israeli occupation** and **bombing campaigns** in Palestine: it's about **defending the West** and **securing regional stability**, even if that means **extending occupation** and **worsening humanitarian crises**.

What is often left out of the equation is that the U.S. and Israel have **repeatedly been the aggressors** in the region. **Israel’s nuclear weapons program** is not only **unacknowledged** by the international community but also **never subject to the same scrutiny** Iran faces, even though Israel maintains **a significant nuclear arsenal** and has used its military to **target neighboring countries**. The **U.S.** is equally guilty of such hypocrisy. For decades, it has **interfered in the region**—whether through direct military intervention or by supporting **authoritarian regimes** that maintain order at the expense of the people.

And yet, when it comes to Iran seeking nuclear capabilities, both the U.S. and Israel cast themselves as the **global arbiters of what is and isn’t acceptable** in terms of weapons development. **The double standard is glaring**. While these powers have **militarized the region**, **propped up despotic regimes**, and **launched devastating airstrikes**, they’re now positioning themselves as the defenders of peace and stability, telling Iran what it can and cannot do. It’s like a thief telling a neighbor not to lock their door while they’ve been robbing houses down the street for years.

This is part of a larger Western imperial project that the subreddit often fails to interrogate. When the U.S. bombs Iran, imposes crippling sanctions on its population, and supports the Israeli military’s daily violence, it’s framed as an exceptional and justified act, necessary for peace and security, despite the fact that these same actions destabilize entire countries and perpetuate cycles of violence. Yet, when Palestinians push back, whether through armed resistance or nonviolent protests, the rhetoric shifts to terrorism and rejectionism.

But here's where the real distortion occurs on r/IsraelPalestine: the reduction of Israeli violence to Netanyahu’s policies. This narrative seeks to isolate the problem to one individual—Benjamin Netanyahu—while glossing over the larger, deeply embedded support for Zionism and Israel's policies within Israeli society. Netanyahu is not the sole actor in this; he represents a wider consensus among many Israelis who actively support the policies of military occupation, apartheid, and ethnic cleansing. This isn't just the rhetoric of one government official—it’s the reality of Israeli state policy, supported by a large section of the Israeli public. To keep framing the issue as simply Netanyahu’s fault is to ignore the structural violence of a state that has existed for over seven decades with its policies largely supported by the Israeli electorate.

Further, a lot of Israelis here (especially ""peaceniks"") regurgitate the narrative that Palestinian citizens of Israel (those who remained after the 1948 Nakba) are somehow the “proof” that Israel isn’t an apartheid state is deeply misleading. The fact that Palestinians living in Israel are used as a cover, a shield to deflect accusations of apartheid, is a hilarious obfuscation of reality. These Palestinians, while technically citizens, remain second-class citizens with no real equality in housing, education, land access, political power, or resources. They live under discriminatory laws that prevent them from accessing many of the same opportunities as Jewish Israelis. They are subject to surveillance, systemic oppression, and are often treated as suspect citizens in their own homeland, particularly when they protest or speak out for Palestinian rights. Claiming that Israel isn't an apartheid state because of this minority group’s legal status ignores the profound inequalities that exist, and, frankly, smacks of a deliberate attempt to shield Israel from valid international criticism.

And yet, on r/IsraelPalestine, this complexity is erased. People speak of “terrorism” without asking what produced it. They invoke atrocities without acknowledging the structures that created the desperation behind them. And they constantly weaponize Jewish historical trauma as a shield for contemporary colonial policy, shutting down critique by collapsing Zionism with Judaism in ways that silence even anti-Zionist Jews.

Let’s be clear: the subreddit does not treat history with any kind of balance. The Nakba is a footnote; the Sabra and Shatila massacre is ignored; the siege of Gaza is abstracted into rocket statistics. But bring up any act of resistance, and the moral clarity becomes blinding. “They started it.” “They rejected peace.” “They hate Jews.” The same users who will tell you the occupation is “complex” and “multifaceted” will reduce the entire Palestinian national movement to antisemitism or religious fanaticism.

And beyond Palestinians, there’s a consistent erasure of how Israeli policy has brutalized the broader region—bombings in Syria and Lebanon, assassinations in Iran, the destabilization of Egypt, and the indirect role Israel played in supporting authoritarian regimes favorable to Western policy. When people from these countries raise grievances, the response is always the same: whataboutism, deflection, and an insistence that any suffering caused by Israel is either exaggerated or deserved.

The underlying message is clear: some lives require context, others are just collateral.

If r/IsraelPalestine wanted to be a genuine forum for difficult, uncomfortable conversations, it would have to do much more than ban slurs and lock threads. It would have to question its own foundations: why Zionism is treated as a legitimate national movement, while Palestinian nationalism is treated as a pathology. Why liberal Zionist fantasies of peace are treated as pragmatism, while Palestinian demands for equality and return are labeled as rejectionism. Why those resisting a siege are constantly asked to justify themselves, while the siege itself is accepted as the natural order of things.

Until that happens, r/IsraelPalestine isn’t a discussion space. It’s just a digital checkpoint—policing what kinds of grief are legitimate, and what kinds of resistance are allowed to exist. I am sure this will get downvoted to oblivion but if you're still a Zionist in the big 25' I doubt anything I say could change your mind",1,financeposter,"This subreddit has a clear pro-Israeli bias If you’ve spent any real time on r/IsraelPalestine, it becomes painfully obvious that the subreddit isn’t actually a neutral space for discussion, it’s a curated stage for a very particular narrative: one that consistently bends toward excusing Zionism, obscuring Palestinian resistance, and laundering Israeli state violence through the language of security, diplomacy, and ""peace.""

2025-06-24 17:19:38,Israel wants to ethnically cleanse Gaza,"Israel has certainly been up to some horrific shit.

Ethnically cleanse the Arab people in Gaza? Nah. The Gazan population has tripled in the last few decades.

It's a poor attempt if they had. The only reason the Arabs/Palestians hadn't fled Gaza is because Eygpt won't let them. Eygpt imposes a huge blockade. I kinda get the whole don't let Israel take the Gaza strip, which is pretty much a baren coastline.

However, I am pretty sure the civilian population, if given the chance, would rather flee and live in Eygpt than staying locked in Gaza. Having to deal with the shit from Hamaz and Israel. Jordan, Syria, Eygpt, and Lebanon let millions of Arabs from Palestine into their countries, which massively de-stablised their countries. Therefore, they now reject any of them coming in. This is the same with Iraq and Saudi. Their own Arab kin don't want them. Too Islamic and terrorist focus to take the risk.","Hey this post I had already published, but I received some comments about an inadequate use of terms or definitions, I know recognize if I was wrong and now I have changed that.

 

Trump’s Gaza plan would end up perpetrating ethnic cleansing now if it were to happen Look, today we can talk about the military actions of Israel and the IDF in Gaza. There are ways, at least in theory, to defend some of what they have done, and yes, certain actions can still be justified. But the moment this is over—when we find out what is really going to happen to the Gaza Strip, and if Trump’s plan from February is carried out—then we are talking about full-blown ethnic cleansing. That is, by manual.

In February, Donald Trump came up with a plan that basically involved forcing everyone in Gaza to leave. That is, literally empty the entire area and relocate more than 2 million people to other countries. Then, the idea was to turn that small strip into what he called a “Riviera”—a luxury resort area. And of course, the United States—a country that hasn’t lost a single soldier or done anything on the ground—would take control.

Seriously, who could support such a plan other than Benjamin Netanyahu? How could anyone, especially an Israeli, agree to forcing an entire population to leave their home? And if the goal is displacement, why not transfer them to Israel? And the worst thing—after all, after sending your soldiers to fight, after taking rocket fire—are you going to let the United States control Gaza?

By definition, that is already ethnic cleansing. This is not 1948. This time, they are talking about forcibly removing over 2 million people from their homes and sending them to foreign countries. No matter how you sell it, neither Israel nor the United States should be the ones controlling the enclave. In what world does that make sense—at least not for a long period of time?

Germany was occupied, of course, but only for a short time—by 1949, it was divided into East and West Germany. The same goes for other countries: even when they are under puppet governments, they remain relatively autonomous—not under total military occupation.

Why not hand over control of Gaza to the Palestinian Authority? Finally, they are the only internationally accepted government of the Palestinian territories and, theoretically, they are the ones who should maintain control of this area and could create, at best, 1 to B, where civilian control is with the authority, Palestine, and security or military control, with Israeli forces.

I agree that a Palestinian state (an Arab state in Palestine) was supposed to be established per the 1947 UN resolution. But it wasn’t and hasn’t been ever since, and for a reason. Palestinians as a nation (I mean Arabs of Palestine) rejected the partition plan and most keep rejecting it. So there is no symmetry here. 

Anyway I’m not against Palestinians as a nation and don’t deny their right to self determination, while whoever promotes destruction of Israel is against Israelis as a nation and thus shouldn’t be on this sub.","If you’ve spent any real time on r/IsraelPalestine, it becomes painfully obvious that the subreddit isn’t actually a neutral space for discussion, it’s a curated stage for a very particular narrative: one that consistently bends toward excusing Zionism, obscuring Palestinian resistance, and laundering Israeli state violence through the language of security, diplomacy, and ""peace.""

At the heart of this is a deep, unspoken bias: Zionism is normalized, even celebrated, while any organized Palestinian or regional response to Zionism is pathologized. The state of Israel, founded through mass displacement and continued military domination, is treated as a given, a nation with existential needs, security concerns, and legitimacy. But when Palestinians resist, whether violently, politically, or through civil disobedience it’s always framed as extremism, terrorism, or refusal to compromise. This framing is not accidental. It’s baked into the logic of the subreddit itself: what kind of speech is upvoted, which voices are platformed, and what types of suffering are seen as “context” rather than central facts.

One of the most frustrating dynamics is the subreddit’s liberal Zionist consensus, a worldview that claims to oppose occupation, but only in theory, only if it doesn’t involve seriously interrogating Jewish supremacy as embedded in Israeli law and policy. These users cling to the fantasy of a “two-state solution” long after even Israeli leaders have discarded it. They offer words of peace, but only if Palestinians accept fragmentation, limited autonomy, and no meaningful return. They’ll express sadness over bombings in Gaza but still frame every war as something “Hamas started.”

What this group often refuses to understand is how, for many Palestinians, and for a surprising number of secular Arabs and Iranians too, groups like Hamas or the IRGC aren't just caricatures of Islamist authoritarianism. They’re seen as responses to something even more suffocating: occupation, siege, bombardment, and decades of Western-backed dispossession. You don’t have to agree with these groups’ ideologies to understand why people who have watched Israeli bombs level their cities, or who live under constant threat of regime change (Reza Pahlavi, the disgraced son of their former corrupt monarch is literally being floated as one of the more likely successors to the regime by the Israeli government) , might view them as defense, as dignity, as something, when the world offers them nothing.

This is especially true in moments of Israeli escalation. When Israeli warplanes flatten residential towers in Gaza, when Israeli politicians openly speak about wiping out “human animals,” when sanctions suffocate Iranian hospitals while foreign powers openly call for “regime change” in Tehran or Damascus—it should be no surprise that even secular citizens, people who might oppose clericalism or militant rhetoric in other contexts, find themselves aligning with resistance factions. Because when your options are annihilation or flawed resistance, survival usually doesn’t ask for ideological purity.

Take, for example, the **r**ecent US airstrike of Iran's nuclear facilities, an act of aggression that, like Israeli airstrikes on Gaza, was framed as a **necessary measure of security**. But in what right does Israel, or the U.S., for that matter have to dictate whether Iran can or cannot pursue nuclear weapons? The logic used to justify these actions is essentially the same logic that’s used to frame **Israeli occupation** and **bombing campaigns** in Palestine: it's about **defending the West** and **securing regional stability**, even if that means **extending occupation** and **worsening humanitarian crises**.

What is often left out of the equation is that the U.S. and Israel have **repeatedly been the aggressors** in the region. **Israel’s nuclear weapons program** is not only **unacknowledged** by the international community but also **never subject to the same scrutiny** Iran faces, even though Israel maintains **a significant nuclear arsenal** and has used its military to **target neighboring countries**. The **U.S.** is equally guilty of such hypocrisy. For decades, it has **interfered in the region**—whether through direct military intervention or by supporting **authoritarian regimes** that maintain order at the expense of the people.

And yet, when it comes to Iran seeking nuclear capabilities, both the U.S. and Israel cast themselves as the **global arbiters of what is and isn’t acceptable** in terms of weapons development. **The double standard is glaring**. While these powers have **militarized the region**, **propped up despotic regimes**, and **launched devastating airstrikes**, they’re now positioning themselves as the defenders of peace and stability, telling Iran what it can and cannot do. It’s like a thief telling a neighbor not to lock their door while they’ve been robbing houses down the street for years.

This is part of a larger Western imperial project that the subreddit often fails to interrogate. When the U.S. bombs Iran, imposes crippling sanctions on its population, and supports the Israeli military’s daily violence, it’s framed as an exceptional and justified act, necessary for peace and security, despite the fact that these same actions destabilize entire countries and perpetuate cycles of violence. Yet, when Palestinians push back, whether through armed resistance or nonviolent protests, the rhetoric shifts to terrorism and rejectionism.

But here's where the real distortion occurs on r/IsraelPalestine: the reduction of Israeli violence to Netanyahu’s policies. This narrative seeks to isolate the problem to one individual—Benjamin Netanyahu—while glossing over the larger, deeply embedded support for Zionism and Israel's policies within Israeli society. Netanyahu is not the sole actor in this; he represents a wider consensus among many Israelis who actively support the policies of military occupation, apartheid, and ethnic cleansing. This isn't just the rhetoric of one government official—it’s the reality of Israeli state policy, supported by a large section of the Israeli public. To keep framing the issue as simply Netanyahu’s fault is to ignore the structural violence of a state that has existed for over seven decades with its policies largely supported by the Israeli electorate.

Further, a lot of Israelis here (especially ""peaceniks"") regurgitate the narrative that Palestinian citizens of Israel (those who remained after the 1948 Nakba) are somehow the “proof” that Israel isn’t an apartheid state is deeply misleading. The fact that Palestinians living in Israel are used as a cover, a shield to deflect accusations of apartheid, is a hilarious obfuscation of reality. These Palestinians, while technically citizens, remain second-class citizens with no real equality in housing, education, land access, political power, or resources. They live under discriminatory laws that prevent them from accessing many of the same opportunities as Jewish Israelis. They are subject to surveillance, systemic oppression, and are often treated as suspect citizens in their own homeland, particularly when they protest or speak out for Palestinian rights. Claiming that Israel isn't an apartheid state because of this minority group’s legal status ignores the profound inequalities that exist, and, frankly, smacks of a deliberate attempt to shield Israel from valid international criticism.

And yet, on r/IsraelPalestine, this complexity is erased. People speak of “terrorism” without asking what produced it. They invoke atrocities without acknowledging the structures that created the desperation behind them. And they constantly weaponize Jewish historical trauma as a shield for contemporary colonial policy, shutting down critique by collapsing Zionism with Judaism in ways that silence even anti-Zionist Jews.

Let’s be clear: the subreddit does not treat history with any kind of balance. The Nakba is a footnote; the Sabra and Shatila massacre is ignored; the siege of Gaza is abstracted into rocket statistics. But bring up any act of resistance, and the moral clarity becomes blinding. “They started it.” “They rejected peace.” “They hate Jews.” The same users who will tell you the occupation is “complex” and “multifaceted” will reduce the entire Palestinian national movement to antisemitism or religious fanaticism.

And beyond Palestinians, there’s a consistent erasure of how Israeli policy has brutalized the broader region—bombings in Syria and Lebanon, assassinations in Iran, the destabilization of Egypt, and the indirect role Israel played in supporting authoritarian regimes favorable to Western policy. When people from these countries raise grievances, the response is always the same: whataboutism, deflection, and an insistence that any suffering caused by Israel is either exaggerated or deserved.

The underlying message is clear: some lives require context, others are just collateral.

If r/IsraelPalestine wanted to be a genuine forum for difficult, uncomfortable conversations, it would have to do much more than ban slurs and lock threads. It would have to question its own foundations: why Zionism is treated as a legitimate national movement, while Palestinian nationalism is treated as a pathology. Why liberal Zionist fantasies of peace are treated as pragmatism, while Palestinian demands for equality and return are labeled as rejectionism. Why those resisting a siege are constantly asked to justify themselves, while the siege itself is accepted as the natural order of things.

Until that happens, r/IsraelPalestine isn’t a discussion space. It’s just a digital checkpoint—policing what kinds of grief are legitimate, and what kinds of resistance are allowed to exist. I am sure this will get downvoted to oblivion but if you're still a Zionist in the big 25' I doubt anything I say could change your mind",1,Motek2,"This subreddit has a clear pro-Israeli bias If you’ve spent any real time on r/IsraelPalestine, it becomes painfully obvious that the subreddit isn’t actually a neutral space for discussion, it’s a curated stage for a very particular narrative: one that consistently bends toward excusing Zionism, obscuring Palestinian resistance, and laundering Israeli state violence through the language of security, diplomacy, and ""peace.""

See, the underlying presumption is already in your comment that Israel has a right to exist, yet Palestine’s existence is somehow up for discussion. This is what I’m talking about. If you’re going to question that, then I’m also able to put into question Israel’s right to exist. You are not treating them equally. This is a common theme I’ve noticed when discussing this issue with Zionists, they feel that Israel’s right to exist and right to the land somehow supersedes everyone else’s.","If you’ve spent any real time on r/IsraelPalestine, it becomes painfully obvious that the subreddit isn’t actually a neutral space for discussion, it’s a curated stage for a very particular narrative: one that consistently bends toward excusing Zionism, obscuring Palestinian resistance, and laundering Israeli state violence through the language of security, diplomacy, and ""peace.""

The state of Israel, founded through mass displacement and continued military domination, is treated as a given, a nation with existential needs, security concerns, and legitimacy. But when Palestinians resist, whether violently, politically, or through civil disobedience it’s always framed as extremism, terrorism, or refusal to compromise. This framing is not accidental.

These users cling to the fantasy of a “two-state solution” long after even Israeli leaders have discarded it. They offer words of peace, but only if Palestinians accept fragmentation, limited autonomy, and no meaningful return. They’ll express sadness over bombings in Gaza but still frame every war as something “Hamas started.”

What this group often refuses to understand is how, for many Palestinians, and for a surprising number of secular Arabs and Iranians too, groups like Hamas or the IRGC aren't just caricatures of Islamist authoritarianism. They’re seen as responses to something even more suffocating: occupation, siege, bombardment, and decades of Western-backed dispossession. You don’t have to agree with these groups’ ideologies to understand why people who have watched Israeli bombs level their cities, or who live under constant threat of regime change (Reza Pahlavi, the disgraced son of their former corrupt monarch is literally being floated as one of the more likely successors to the regime by the Israeli government) , might view them as defense, as dignity, as something, when the world offers them nothing.

This is especially true in moments of Israeli escalation. When Israeli warplanes flatten residential towers in Gaza, when Israeli politicians openly speak about wiping out “human animals,” when sanctions suffocate Iranian hospitals while foreign powers openly call for “regime change” in Tehran or Damascus—it should be no surprise that even secular citizens, people who might oppose clericalism or militant rhetoric in other contexts, find themselves aligning with resistance factions. Because when your options are annihilation or flawed resistance, survival usually doesn’t ask for ideological purity.

Take, for example, the **r**ecent US airstrike of Iran's nuclear facilities, an act of aggression that, like Israeli airstrikes on Gaza, was framed as a **necessary measure of security**. But in what right does Israel, or the U.S., for that matter have to dictate whether Iran can or cannot pursue nuclear weapons? The logic used to justify these actions is essentially the same logic that’s used to frame **Israeli occupation** and **bombing campaigns** in Palestine: it's about **defending the West** and **securing regional stability**, even if that means **extending occupation** and **worsening humanitarian crises**.

What is often left out of the equation is that the U.S. and Israel have **repeatedly been the aggressors** in the region. **Israel’s nuclear weapons program** is not only **unacknowledged** by the international community but also **never subject to the same scrutiny** Iran faces, even though Israel maintains **a significant nuclear arsenal** and has used its military to **target neighboring countries**. The **U.S.** is equally guilty of such hypocrisy. For decades, it has **interfered in the region**—whether through direct military intervention or by supporting **authoritarian regimes** that maintain order at the expense of the people.

And yet, when it comes to Iran seeking nuclear capabilities, both the U.S. and Israel cast themselves as the **global arbiters of what is and isn’t acceptable** in terms of weapons development. **The double standard is glaring**. While these powers have **militarized the region**, **propped up despotic regimes**, and **launched devastating airstrikes**, they’re now positioning themselves as the defenders of peace and stability, telling Iran what it can and cannot do. It’s like a thief telling a neighbor not to lock their door while they’ve been robbing houses down the street for years.

This is part of a larger Western imperial project that the subreddit often fails to interrogate. When the U.S. bombs Iran, imposes crippling sanctions on its population, and supports the Israeli military’s daily violence, it’s framed as an exceptional and justified act, necessary for peace and security, despite the fact that these same actions destabilize entire countries and perpetuate cycles of violence. Yet, when Palestinians push back, whether through armed resistance or nonviolent protests, the rhetoric shifts to terrorism and rejectionism.

But here's where the real distortion occurs on r/IsraelPalestine: the reduction of Israeli violence to Netanyahu’s policies. This narrative seeks to isolate the problem to one individual—Benjamin Netanyahu—while glossing over the larger, deeply embedded support for Zionism and Israel's policies within Israeli society. Netanyahu is not the sole actor in this; he represents a wider consensus among many Israelis who actively support the policies of military occupation, apartheid, and ethnic cleansing. This isn't just the rhetoric of one government official—it’s the reality of Israeli state policy, supported by a large section of the Israeli public. To keep framing the issue as simply Netanyahu’s fault is to ignore the structural violence of a state that has existed for over seven decades with its policies largely supported by the Israeli electorate.

Further, a lot of Israelis here (especially ""peaceniks"") regurgitate the narrative that Palestinian citizens of Israel (those who remained after the 1948 Nakba) are somehow the “proof” that Israel isn’t an apartheid state is deeply misleading. The fact that Palestinians living in Israel are used as a cover, a shield to deflect accusations of apartheid, is a hilarious obfuscation of reality. These Palestinians, while technically citizens, remain second-class citizens with no real equality in housing, education, land access, political power, or resources. They live under discriminatory laws that prevent them from accessing many of the same opportunities as Jewish Israelis. They are subject to surveillance, systemic oppression, and are often treated as suspect citizens in their own homeland, particularly when they protest or speak out for Palestinian rights. Claiming that Israel isn't an apartheid state because of this minority group’s legal status ignores the profound inequalities that exist, and, frankly, smacks of a deliberate attempt to shield Israel from valid international criticism.

And yet, on r/IsraelPalestine, this complexity is erased. People speak of “terrorism” without asking what produced it. They invoke atrocities without acknowledging the structures that created the desperation behind them. And they constantly weaponize Jewish historical trauma as a shield for contemporary colonial policy, shutting down critique by collapsing Zionism with Judaism in ways that silence even anti-Zionist Jews.

Let’s be clear: the subreddit does not treat history with any kind of balance. The Nakba is a footnote; the Sabra and Shatila massacre is ignored; the siege of Gaza is abstracted into rocket statistics. But bring up any act of resistance, and the moral clarity becomes blinding. “They started it.” “They rejected peace.” “They hate Jews.” The same users who will tell you the occupation is “complex” and “multifaceted” will reduce the entire Palestinian national movement to antisemitism or religious fanaticism.

And beyond Palestinians, there’s a consistent erasure of how Israeli policy has brutalized the broader region—bombings in Syria and Lebanon, assassinations in Iran, the destabilization of Egypt, and the indirect role Israel played in supporting authoritarian regimes favorable to Western policy. When people from these countries raise grievances, the response is always the same: whataboutism, deflection, and an insistence that any suffering caused by Israel is either exaggerated or deserved.

The underlying message is clear: some lives require context, others are just collateral.

If r/IsraelPalestine wanted to be a genuine forum for difficult, uncomfortable conversations, it would have to do much more than ban slurs and lock threads. It would have to question its own foundations: why Zionism is treated as a legitimate national movement, while Palestinian nationalism is treated as a pathology. Why liberal Zionist fantasies of peace are treated as pragmatism, while Palestinian demands for equality and return are labeled as rejectionism. Why those resisting a siege are constantly asked to justify themselves, while the siege itself is accepted as the natural order of things.

Until that happens, r/IsraelPalestine isn’t a discussion space. It’s just a digital checkpoint—policing what kinds of grief are legitimate, and what kinds of resistance are allowed to exist. I am sure this will get downvoted to oblivion but if you're still a Zionist in the big 25' I doubt anything I say could change your mind",1,financeposter,"This subreddit has a clear pro-Israeli bias If you’ve spent any real time on r/IsraelPalestine, it becomes painfully obvious that the subreddit isn’t actually a neutral space for discussion, it’s a curated stage for a very particular narrative: one that consistently bends toward excusing Zionism, obscuring Palestinian resistance, and laundering Israeli state violence through the language of security, diplomacy, and ""peace.""

What is often left out of the equation is that the U.S. and Israel have **repeatedly been the aggressors** in the region. **Israel’s nuclear weapons program** is not only **unacknowledged** by the international community but also **never subject to the same scrutiny** Iran faces, even though Israel maintains **a significant nuclear arsenal** and has used its military to **target neighboring countries**. The **U.S.** is equally guilty of such hypocrisy. For decades, it has **interfered in the region**—whether through direct military intervention or by supporting **authoritarian regimes** that maintain order at the expense of the people.

And yet, when it comes to Iran seeking nuclear capabilities, both the U.S. and Israel cast themselves as the **global arbiters of what is and isn’t acceptable** in terms of weapons development. **The double standard is glaring**. While these powers have **militarized the region**, **propped up despotic regimes**, and **launched devastating airstrikes**, they’re now positioning themselves as the defenders of peace and stability, telling Iran what it can and cannot do. It’s like a thief telling a neighbor not to lock their door while they’ve been robbing houses down the street for years.

This is part of a larger Western imperial project that the subreddit often fails to interrogate. When the U.S. bombs Iran, imposes crippling sanctions on its population, and supports the Israeli military’s daily violence, it’s framed as an exceptional and justified act, necessary for peace and security, despite the fact that these same actions destabilize entire countries and perpetuate cycles of violence. Yet, when Palestinians push back, whether through armed resistance or nonviolent protests, the rhetoric shifts to terrorism and rejectionism.

But here's where the real distortion occurs on r/IsraelPalestine: the reduction of Israeli violence to Netanyahu’s policies. This narrative seeks to isolate the problem to one individual—Benjamin Netanyahu—while glossing over the larger, deeply embedded support for Zionism and Israel's policies within Israeli society. Netanyahu is not the sole actor in this; he represents a wider consensus among many Israelis who actively support the policies of military occupation, apartheid, and ethnic cleansing. This isn't just the rhetoric of one government official—it’s the reality of Israeli state policy, supported by a large section of the Israeli public. To keep framing the issue as simply Netanyahu’s fault is to ignore the structural violence of a state that has existed for over seven decades with its policies largely supported by the Israeli electorate.

Further, a lot of Israelis here (especially ""peaceniks"") regurgitate the narrative that Palestinian citizens of Israel (those who remained after the 1948 Nakba) are somehow the “proof” that Israel isn’t an apartheid state is deeply misleading. The fact that Palestinians living in Israel are used as a cover, a shield to deflect accusations of apartheid, is a hilarious obfuscation of reality. These Palestinians, while technically citizens, remain second-class citizens with no real equality in housing, education, land access, political power, or resources. They live under discriminatory laws that prevent them from accessing many of the same opportunities as Jewish Israelis. They are subject to surveillance, systemic oppression, and are often treated as suspect citizens in their own homeland, particularly when they protest or speak out for Palestinian rights. Claiming that Israel isn't an apartheid state because of this minority group’s legal status ignores the profound inequalities that exist, and, frankly, smacks of a deliberate attempt to shield Israel from valid international criticism.

And yet, on r/IsraelPalestine, this complexity is erased. People speak of “terrorism” without asking what produced it. They invoke atrocities without acknowledging the structures that created the desperation behind them. And they constantly weaponize Jewish historical trauma as a shield for contemporary colonial policy, shutting down critique by collapsing Zionism with Judaism in ways that silence even anti-Zionist Jews.

Let’s be clear: the subreddit does not treat history with any kind of balance. The Nakba is a footnote; the Sabra and Shatila massacre is ignored; the siege of Gaza is abstracted into rocket statistics. But bring up any act of resistance, and the moral clarity becomes blinding. “They started it.” “They rejected peace.” “They hate Jews.” The same users who will tell you the occupation is “complex” and “multifaceted” will reduce the entire Palestinian national movement to antisemitism or religious fanaticism.

And beyond Palestinians, there’s a consistent erasure of how Israeli policy has brutalized the broader region—bombings in Syria and Lebanon, assassinations in Iran, the destabilization of Egypt, and the indirect role Israel played in supporting authoritarian regimes favorable to Western policy. When people from these countries raise grievances, the response is always the same: whataboutism, deflection, and an insistence that any suffering caused by Israel is either exaggerated or deserved.

The underlying message is clear: some lives require context, others are just collateral.

If r/IsraelPalestine wanted to be a genuine forum for difficult, uncomfortable conversations, it would have to do much more than ban slurs and lock threads. It would have to question its own foundations: why Zionism is treated as a legitimate national movement, while Palestinian nationalism is treated as a pathology. Why liberal Zionist fantasies of peace are treated as pragmatism, while Palestinian demands for equality and return are labeled as rejectionism. Why those resisting a siege are constantly asked to justify themselves, while the siege itself is accepted as the natural order of things.

Until that happens, r/IsraelPalestine isn’t a discussion space. It’s just a digital checkpoint—policing what kinds of grief are legitimate, and what kinds of resistance are allowed to exist. I am sure this will get downvoted to oblivion but if you're still a Zionist in the big 25' I doubt anything I say could change your mind",1,External-Anybody7957,"This subreddit has a clear pro-Israeli bias If you’ve spent any real time on r/IsraelPalestine, it becomes painfully obvious that the subreddit isn’t actually a neutral space for discussion, it’s a curated stage for a very particular narrative: one that consistently bends toward excusing Zionism, obscuring Palestinian resistance, and laundering Israeli state violence through the language of security, diplomacy, and ""peace."" At the heart of this is a deep, unspoken bias: Zionism is normalized, even celebrated, while any organized Palestinian or regional response to Zionism is pathologized. The state of Israel, founded through mass displacement and continued military domination, is treated as a given, a nation with existential needs, security concerns, and legitimacy. But when Palestinians resist, whether violently, politically, or through civil disobedience it’s always framed as extremism, terrorism, or refusal to compromise. This framing is not accidental. It’s baked into the logic of the subreddit itself: what kind of speech is upvoted, which voices are platformed, and what types of suffering are seen as “context” rather than central facts. One of the most frustrating dynamics is the subreddit’s liberal Zionist consensus, a worldview that claims to oppose occupation, but only in theory, only if it doesn’t involve seriously interrogating Jewish supremacy as embedded in Israeli law and policy. These users cling to the fantasy of a “two-state solution” long after even Israeli leaders have discarded it. They offer words of peace, but only if Palestinians accept fragmentation, limited autonomy, and no meaningful return. They’ll express sadness over bombings in Gaza but still frame every war as something “Hamas started.” What this group often refuses to understand is how, for many Palestinians, and for a surprising number of secular Arabs and Iranians too, groups like Hamas or the IRGC aren't just caricatures of Islamist authoritarianism. They’re seen as responses to something even more suffocating: occupation, siege, bombardment, and decades of Western-backed dispossession. You don’t have to agree with these groups’ ideologies to understand why people who have watched Israeli bombs level their cities, or who live under constant threat of regime change (Reza Pahlavi, the disgraced son of their former corrupt monarch is literally being floated as one of the more likely successors to the regime by the Israeli government) , might view them as defense, as dignity, as something, when the world offers them nothing. This is especially true in moments of Israeli escalation. When Israeli warplanes flatten residential towers in Gaza, when Israeli politicians openly speak about wiping out “human animals,” when sanctions suffocate Iranian hospitals while foreign powers openly call for “regime change” in Tehran or Damascus—it should be no surprise that even secular citizens, people who might oppose clericalism or militant rhetoric in other contexts, find themselves aligning with resistance factions. Because when your options are annihilation or flawed resistance, survival usually doesn’t ask for ideological purity.

The Israelites were people that followed the laws of Moses. People converted to Judaism and became Israelites. If we believe the whole myth then Moses led the believers to the lands of the Hittites, Philistines, and a bunch of other people and they murdered them and stolen their land as God directed them to. There are so many holes in the whole story that you Zionists dribble that it is like a sieve. The exodus, the exile, the myth of the Jewish People as a single ethnicity or race. The whole 'there is no Palestine' is just gas lighting drivel. 

In the grand scheme of things how ancient is even 2000 years when homo sapiens have existed for 200,000 years? All of these dumb labels and social constructs and modern ones at that. Ancient is my mob - here in Australia for at least 45,000 years and I was recently told by a dopey Zionist who lives on my stolen land that they would give my land back if I ""bought their family back who died in the gas chambers"". How cooked is that? Everyone except the Germans, Europeans and the Chrisitians who were/are truly antisemitic dont have to pay for their crimes. Aboriginal Australian and Palestinians do. 

You are a Zionist troll and a genocide apologist. Grow a pair and go fight Hamas.","Let's be real: the idea of a ""Palestinian people"" isn't some ancient truth. It's a story cooked up and used as a weapon by Arab and Islamist groups to bash Israel. Nobody was clamoring for a ""Palestinian State"" back in the day.

Think about it. After the 1948 war, did the Arab nations jump to create a Palestinian homeland? Nope. Jordan just grabbed the West Bank, and Egypt took over Gaza. They weren't fighting for ""Palestine""; they were fighting for more land for themselves. The ""All-Palestine Government"" set up in Gaza was a joke, a puppet on Egypt's strings. It was about taking territory, not setting up a new country.

This whole ""Palestinian identity"" really kicked into high gear after 1967, when Israel ended up with land those Arab nations used to control. Suddenly, after failing to wipe Israel off the map in a straight-up fight, the game changed. The ""stateless Palestinian"" became the perfect prop, a sob story to parade around the world to make Israel look bad. It was a slick move: shift from trying to destroy a country to claiming to fight for a ""native people's"" freedom.

This made-up identity has one clear goal: to make Israel illegitimate. Why admit Jews have ancient ties to the land when you can claim a long, unbroken Palestinian history that just happened to pop up in the late 20th century? These folks weren't ""Palestinians"" before; they were Arabs living in a region, often seeing themselves as part of Syria or just a bigger Arab world.

The ""Palestinian people"" is a political invention, a tool for those who want to wipe Israel off the map under the banner of ""liberation."" The world has mostly fallen for it, ignoring what actually happened and buying into a story designed for endless conflict, not real peace.

2025-06-24 17:44:10,Why did Israeli officials call IDF rapists “heroes”?,he was one of the commanders,"A few weeks ago a leaked CCTV clip showed Israeli reservists brutally gang-raping a bound Palestinian detainee inside the Sde Teiman military detention camp. The video triggered a military police investigation and the detention of several soldiers for questioning.

Instead of condemning the abuse, far-right activists and some elected officials rushed to defend those soldiers as “heroes.” In late July dozens of masked protesters stormed the Sde Teiman base and then the Beit Lid facility, clashing with military police and demanding the immediate release of the accused. They carried Israeli flags, chanted that the arrests were a betrayal of the IDF, and tried to block the legal process.

Several high-ranking ministers even took to social media. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich posted on X that Israel’s “heroic warriors” must be protected and insisted the probe was a witch-hunt against the army. Transportation Minister Miri Regev warned in her tweet that prosecuting soldiers mid-war was “dangerous” and only served to appease Israel’s enemies. Economy Minister Nir Barkat also tweeted support, calling on officials to back the fighters rather than punish them.


The man in question did not participate in the October 7th attacks, and was not among the Nukhba forces. … Contrary to what was claimed, he was not a commander in Hamas… but rather lived in the Jabaliya refugee camp.￼

Most people there have not been trialed or confirmed to be Hamas members, some are doctors and aid workers.

The military referred to him at first as a “suspected Hamas fighter,” even claiming he was from the elite Nukhba unit  ￼.
	
Later investigations found no record of him being charged or formally linked to Hamas .
	
According to leaked court documents and reporting, he was most likely a low-level security officer from Jabalia, not a combatant. He hadn’t been arrested on October 7, only in March—and detainees like him are often held without transparent charges

2025-06-23 04:55:30,The Palestinian Charade: A manufactured people for a political agenda,That’s an excellent argument. I hadn’t looked at the situation like that before. You’ve given me a lot to think about.,"Let's be real: the idea of a ""Palestinian people"" isn't some ancient truth. It's a story cooked up and used as a weapon by Arab and Islamist groups to bash Israel. Nobody was clamoring for a ""Palestinian State"" back in the day.

Think about it. After the 1948 war, did the Arab nations jump to create a Palestinian homeland? Nope. Jordan just grabbed the West Bank, and Egypt took over Gaza. They weren't fighting for ""Palestine""; they were fighting for more land for themselves. The ""All-Palestine Government"" set up in Gaza was a joke, a puppet on Egypt's strings. It was about taking territory, not setting up a new country.

This whole ""Palestinian identity"" really kicked into high gear after 1967, when Israel ended up with land those Arab nations used to control. Suddenly, after failing to wipe Israel off the map in a straight-up fight, the game changed. The ""stateless Palestinian"" became the perfect prop, a sob story to parade around the world to make Israel look bad. It was a slick move: shift from trying to destroy a country to claiming to fight for a ""native people's"" freedom.

This made-up identity has one clear goal: to make Israel illegitimate. Why admit Jews have ancient ties to the land when you can claim a long, unbroken Palestinian history that just happened to pop up in the late 20th century? These folks weren't ""Palestinians"" before; they were Arabs living in a region, often seeing themselves as part of Syria or just a bigger Arab world.

The ""Palestinian people"" is a political invention, a tool for those who want to wipe Israel off the map under the banner of ""liberation."" The world has mostly fallen for it, ignoring what actually happened and buying into a story designed for endless conflict, not real peace.

2025-06-22 14:27:03,"People who are in defense of Iran, please explain.","The lesson Israel took from the attack which started the most recent war in Gaza was that Palestinians (and by extention Iran) would make an attack knowing what response was likely. Hamas attacked and killed about a thousand Israelis and its not exactly a stretch to believe they knew that their own leadership, members and much of Gaza would be destroyed in response.


Israel knows it is hated. They strongly suspect Iran would just use the nukes on a preemptive strike. 


Doesn't make their attack morally correct, but tactically they didn't have much option.","I genuinely want to hear your complete opinion from A to Z so I can understand because as someone who feels differently on this topic, it's hard for me to understand your position. I have a pretty nuanced position on the greater conflict here. I'm not strictly on one side or the other.

To try to simplify/summarize my position: I think what Israel is doing in Gaza is wrong. I think Israel had a right to defend itself, to return its hostages home, but the approach it chose was morally wrong and also strategically wrong due to the reputational damage it caused. I don't think Israel should have been founded 80 years ago - This was a great mistake on the part of the West, but it is not a mistake that should be undone. It is useless to consider rectifying it now. The important thing is what course of action should be taken going forward. As someone who lives in the west and believes in western values, I believe that Israel should continue to exist going forward, and that Israel existing is better than the alternative. In a perfect world, I would like to see a two state solution, but I don't think this is realistic. Both israelis and palestinians do not want this. You can't force a solution on two parties that neither party agrees to.

Moving onto Iran - I feel that many western people sympathize with Iran purely as an extension of their distaste for whats happening in Gaza, which makes very little sense to me.

I have a very pragmatic way of thinking about this situation, and this makes it hard for me to understand why these people feel the way they do. I guess that I would like to hear what the proposed solution is for people on the other side of this issue? Should all jews be removed from Israel and sent back to Europe/elsewhere, and should Iran be left to its own devices? Do you presume that Iran is a benevolent actor or that by removing all jews from Israel, Iran would stop there and would become a peaceful and positive partner to western nations?

From my view, Iran is a theocracy, and its leadership fundamentally despises Israel, the US, and the west as a whole. If you value the continuity and success of western society, Iran is at best an instigator, and at worst an enemy. While the people of Iran don't necessarily embody these ideals, the leadership clearly does. I think that it is clear that Iran at a minimum wants to use nuclear development as leverage to exort the west. It is at minimum a bargaining chip that can be abused to get concessions from the west. The more pessimistic view is that Iran would like to become a nuclear armed state. I am pessimistic here. Nuclear capability coupled with Iran's missiles program would give it enormous leverage over the west, similar to the leverage North Korea has, but even greater. I think it is naive to believe that this is not the case, and that Iran is some peaceful nation with a nuclear power program, and no goals of weaponization, simply being propagandized and mischaracterized by the West.

I don't know that there is an easy solution here - wars in the middle east don't tend to be very fruitful over the long term. I think that the current course of action has been appropriate. Bombing and dismantling Iran's nuclear program and killing its leadership is a net positive for the West. A nuclear armed Iran is incredibly problematic for anyone with western values in my opinion, and again, thinking that Iran is not trying to achieve that goal is incredibly naive.

Would love to hear different perspectives here so I can understand the reasoning of people who feel differently. I want to understand what you would like to happen in this region, and why you believe this is a better future for humanity or in line with your values, and please consider the long term implications of different courses of action.",1,Hungry-Western9191,"People who are in defense of Iran, please explain.

2025-06-24 08:37:32,We need to introspect ourselves,"Yes, I am not defending Israel, I myself do not like them, but being busy expecting Israel to be good by blaming them is a stupid thing

We blame it on the West, Israel's crimes and so on. We forget that we ourselves who are reckless and underestimate them to the deepest point.

Logically it does not make sense that a small country like Israel could be so powerful in a very large area as large as the Middle East if not for our **extreme incompetence**

What's worse is that we are indeed in a different polarity with equally fatal consequences. One side glorifies fatalism without wanting to make an effort. One side does not like patience and likes to fight without being prepared.

In the past, Arab countries lost in just 6 days. Now they are even further behind. Hezbollah, which in 2006 was able to hold Israel back, is now losing before they even have a chance to fight

The episodes of defeat are endless, Israel continues to develop themselves, they continue to learn from their shortcomings and also the weaknesses of their enemies. While we are quickly satisfied and only like instant goals.

This instant way of thinking should be minimalized, lets start building long-term targets, build civilization first. Release all our resources, both religion, culture, social, science, both youth, men and women. 

\- A group of stupid people take the instant way by throwing away their identity, leaving Islam, selling themselves to be accepted by the West

\- Another group of stupid people completely reject modernity, and remain rigid in their narrow religious views.

All of them are equally stupid. We still have to be ourselves. But take positive values ​​from outsiders to learn. Sometimes I feel that the Mu'tazila civilization was much better than today.

I once had a discussion with an Indian Nationalist, basically he did not have the slightest respect for Muslims in MENA. From Sunni to Shia, both Arab, Turkish, Persian, and others

He associated it with all things negative. He gave me the opportunity to refute, but basically he was right.

If it continues like this, there will be a time when we will only be the lowest caste in society, we will never get even a little respect even for everyday life

Just so you know, today the threat is more multidimensional. Today the global dehumanization project of Muslims is being promoted through Islamophobic campaigns and ultra-nationalist movements

Ultimately we are forced to hate ourselves to feel regret for being born","This sub is filled with expressions of disappointment. Some are upset by Indian nationalists, Zionists , and many more. Yet if we are degraded for our faith, is the true fault with those who insult us? In reality, the fault lies within ourselves.

For far too long, we have been stereotyped as backward. Few remember the positive contributions our community has made to modern civilization, even though our history abounds with remarkable achievements.

Instead of self-reform and personal growth or make better system and civilization. we fall into needless conflicts. These clashes occur not only with external foes but also among Muslims themselves. Some celebrate Iran’s setbacks, others cheer when Palestine suffers, and some resort to extreme, senseless 

Yet we could revive universal values: humanity, empathy, collaboration, and scientific inquiry. Unfortunately, many still cling to primitive attitudes : quick to anger; easily satisfied with minor victories;  overly trusting; prone to betrayal; indulging in luxury and living without clear purpose.

If we refuse to introspect and improve ourselves, this cycle of disappointment will persist. True respect from others can only come when we first respect and honor ourselves.

Short word, we need to grow :

Innovation  
Security  
Unity

2025-06-23 13:12:29,This subreddit has a clear pro-Israeli bias,"Yes, as an Israeli, I think that establishment of a Palestinian state alongside with Israel right now is a very bad idea. It will lead to a war even worse than the one started by Gaza on Oct 7. However I don’t suggest to silence all these voices who support a Palestinian state. Whoever supports a Palestinian state right now - I think it’s a mistake but it’s a legitimate opinion and I will not complain that it is voiced on this sub.

Edit. Just to clarify. I’m not against Palestinian right for self determination. I’m against establishing a Palestinian state right now. It is absolutely not symmetrical to supporting *destruction* of the state of Israel.","If you’ve spent any real time on r/IsraelPalestine, it becomes painfully obvious that the subreddit isn’t actually a neutral space for discussion, it’s a curated stage for a very particular narrative: one that consistently bends toward excusing Zionism, obscuring Palestinian resistance, and laundering Israeli state violence through the language of security, diplomacy, and ""peace.""

At the heart of this is a deep, unspoken bias: Zionism is normalized, even celebrated, while any organized Palestinian or regional response to Zionism is pathologized. The state of Israel, founded through mass displacement and continued military domination, is treated as a given, a nation with existential needs, security concerns, and legitimacy. But when Palestinians resist, whether violently, politically, or through civil disobedience it’s always framed as extremism, terrorism, or refusal to compromise. This framing is not accidental. It’s baked into the logic of the subreddit itself: what kind of speech is upvoted, which voices are platformed, and what types of suffering are seen as “context” rather than central facts.

One of the most frustrating dynamics is the subreddit’s liberal Zionist consensus, a worldview that claims to oppose occupation, but only in theory, only if it doesn’t involve seriously interrogating Jewish supremacy as embedded in Israeli law and policy. These users cling to the fantasy of a “two-state solution” long after even Israeli leaders have discarded it. They offer words of peace, but only if Palestinians accept fragmentation, limited autonomy, and no meaningful return. They’ll express sadness over bombings in Gaza but still frame every war as something “Hamas started.”

What this group often refuses to understand is how, for many Palestinians, and for a surprising number of secular Arabs and Iranians too, groups like Hamas or the IRGC aren't just caricatures of Islamist authoritarianism. They’re seen as responses to something even more suffocating: occupation, siege, bombardment, and decades of Western-backed dispossession. You don’t have to agree with these groups’ ideologies to understand why people who have watched Israeli bombs level their cities, or who live under constant threat of regime change (Reza Pahlavi, the disgraced son of their former corrupt monarch is literally being floated as one of the more likely successors to the regime by the Israeli government) , might view them as defense, as dignity, as something, when the world offers them nothing.

This is especially true in moments of Israeli escalation. When Israeli warplanes flatten residential towers in Gaza, when Israeli politicians openly speak about wiping out “human animals,” when sanctions suffocate Iranian hospitals while foreign powers openly call for “regime change” in Tehran or Damascus—it should be no surprise that even secular citizens, people who might oppose clericalism or militant rhetoric in other contexts, find themselves aligning with resistance factions. Because when your options are annihilation or flawed resistance, survival usually doesn’t ask for ideological purity.

Take, for example, the **r**ecent US airstrike of Iran's nuclear facilities, an act of aggression that, like Israeli airstrikes on Gaza, was framed as a **necessary measure of security**. But in what right does Israel, or the U.S., for that matter have to dictate whether Iran can or cannot pursue nuclear weapons? The logic used to justify these actions is essentially the same logic that’s used to frame **Israeli occupation** and **bombing campaigns** in Palestine: it's about **defending the West** and **securing regional stability**, even if that means **extending occupation** and **worsening humanitarian crises**.

What is often left out of the equation is that the U.S. and Israel have **repeatedly been the aggressors** in the region. **Israel’s nuclear weapons program** is not only **unacknowledged** by the international community but also **never subject to the same scrutiny** Iran faces, even though Israel maintains **a significant nuclear arsenal** and has used its military to **target neighboring countries**. The **U.S.** is equally guilty of such hypocrisy. For decades, it has **interfered in the region**—whether through direct military intervention or by supporting **authoritarian regimes** that maintain order at the expense of the people.

And yet, when it comes to Iran seeking nuclear capabilities, both the U.S. and Israel cast themselves as the **global arbiters of what is and isn’t acceptable** in terms of weapons development. **The double standard is glaring**. While these powers have **militarized the region**, **propped up despotic regimes**, and **launched devastating airstrikes**, they’re now positioning themselves as the defenders of peace and stability, telling Iran what it can and cannot do. It’s like a thief telling a neighbor not to lock their door while they’ve been robbing houses down the street for years.

This is part of a larger Western imperial project that the subreddit often fails to interrogate. When the U.S. bombs Iran, imposes crippling sanctions on its population, and supports the Israeli military’s daily violence, it’s framed as an exceptional and justified act, necessary for peace and security, despite the fact that these same actions destabilize entire countries and perpetuate cycles of violence. Yet, when Palestinians push back, whether through armed resistance or nonviolent protests, the rhetoric shifts to terrorism and rejectionism.

But here's where the real distortion occurs on r/IsraelPalestine: the reduction of Israeli violence to Netanyahu’s policies. This narrative seeks to isolate the problem to one individual—Benjamin Netanyahu—while glossing over the larger, deeply embedded support for Zionism and Israel's policies within Israeli society. Netanyahu is not the sole actor in this; he represents a wider consensus among many Israelis who actively support the policies of military occupation, apartheid, and ethnic cleansing. This isn't just the rhetoric of one government official—it’s the reality of Israeli state policy, supported by a large section of the Israeli public. To keep framing the issue as simply Netanyahu’s fault is to ignore the structural violence of a state that has existed for over seven decades with its policies largely supported by the Israeli electorate.

Further, a lot of Israelis here (especially ""peaceniks"") regurgitate the narrative that Palestinian citizens of Israel (those who remained after the 1948 Nakba) are somehow the “proof” that Israel isn’t an apartheid state is deeply misleading. The fact that Palestinians living in Israel are used as a cover, a shield to deflect accusations of apartheid, is a hilarious obfuscation of reality. These Palestinians, while technically citizens, remain second-class citizens with no real equality in housing, education, land access, political power, or resources. They live under discriminatory laws that prevent them from accessing many of the same opportunities as Jewish Israelis. They are subject to surveillance, systemic oppression, and are often treated as suspect citizens in their own homeland, particularly when they protest or speak out for Palestinian rights. Claiming that Israel isn't an apartheid state because of this minority group’s legal status ignores the profound inequalities that exist, and, frankly, smacks of a deliberate attempt to shield Israel from valid international criticism.

And yet, on r/IsraelPalestine, this complexity is erased. People speak of “terrorism” without asking what produced it. They invoke atrocities without acknowledging the structures that created the desperation behind them. And they constantly weaponize Jewish historical trauma as a shield for contemporary colonial policy, shutting down critique by collapsing Zionism with Judaism in ways that silence even anti-Zionist Jews.

Let’s be clear: the subreddit does not treat history with any kind of balance. The Nakba is a footnote; the Sabra and Shatila massacre is ignored; the siege of Gaza is abstracted into rocket statistics. But bring up any act of resistance, and the moral clarity becomes blinding. “They started it.” “They rejected peace.” “They hate Jews.” The same users who will tell you the occupation is “complex” and “multifaceted” will reduce the entire Palestinian national movement to antisemitism or religious fanaticism.

And beyond Palestinians, there’s a consistent erasure of how Israeli policy has brutalized the broader region—bombings in Syria and Lebanon, assassinations in Iran, the destabilization of Egypt, and the indirect role Israel played in supporting authoritarian regimes favorable to Western policy. When people from these countries raise grievances, the response is always the same: whataboutism, deflection, and an insistence that any suffering caused by Israel is either exaggerated or deserved.

The underlying message is clear: some lives require context, others are just collateral.

If r/IsraelPalestine wanted to be a genuine forum for difficult, uncomfortable conversations, it would have to do much more than ban slurs and lock threads. It would have to question its own foundations: why Zionism is treated as a legitimate national movement, while Palestinian nationalism is treated as a pathology. Why liberal Zionist fantasies of peace are treated as pragmatism, while Palestinian demands for equality and return are labeled as rejectionism. Why those resisting a siege are constantly asked to justify themselves, while the siege itself is accepted as the natural order of things.

Until that happens, r/IsraelPalestine isn’t a discussion space. It’s just a digital checkpoint—policing what kinds of grief are legitimate, and what kinds of resistance are allowed to exist. I am sure this will get downvoted to oblivion but if you're still a Zionist in the big 25' I doubt anything I say could change your mind",1,Motek2,"This subreddit has a clear pro-Israeli bias If you’ve spent any real time on r/IsraelPalestine, it becomes painfully obvious that the subreddit isn’t actually a neutral space for discussion, it’s a curated stage for a very particular narrative: one that consistently bends toward excusing Zionism, obscuring Palestinian resistance, and laundering Israeli state violence through the language of security, diplomacy, and ""peace.""

[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W6vaQPTDq\_iD9jKWEXBV59GzOV1GYSCVikXRUCz4puw/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W6vaQPTDq_iD9jKWEXBV59GzOV1GYSCVikXRUCz4puw/edit?usp=sharing)

I wanted to know what both Palestinians and their supporters think, as well as Israelis, the diaspora and the Pro-Israelis think of this, it's a bit boring but I had a lot of fun making it lol, though I made this before June 13th, so it may have some weird out-of-date terms/articles.



In accordance with the rules and the character count, I'll put in the preamble here;

  
**Preamble;** 

Within the solutions of the Israel-Palestine Conflict, many have put forward two main solutions, deemed; “The Two State Solution”, which prefers both an Israeli state and a Palestinian State, and “The One State Solution”, which prefers one single, preferably secular state containing both the Arabs and Jewish in the region.



Within the Middle East Region, the Jews and the Arabs have been fighting over the Holy Land throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. Despite these many conflicts, the Israeli government has been adamant about maintaining peace in the Middle East since the War of 1973.



The subject matter is of controversial matter, however we affirm to our best ability that everything proceeding is unbiased, and stated true by multiple sources from both parties.



The Israeli Government, has now come forward with a plan of action to solve the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict.



Let us start by showing some pros and cons of both solutions;

||
||
|Solution|Pros|Cons|
|“One State Solution”|Allows for a single nation to govern the peoples in the region. A single government would be more capable in decisively solving internal issues. Would remove external factors or other would-be actors from interfering in Arab-Jewish issues. Removed borders, allowing for free-movement for both parties within the nation.|Wealth Inequality would be vast as the Educated Jewish Population would economically dominate the nation. The Arab Population may become larger than the Jewish one, whilst being marginalized, creating an extremely divided nation. No side would be happy as the joint-nation would not be “Jewish” or “Palestinian”, compromising both ethnic groups’ right to self-determination.|
|“Two State Solution”|Both parties retain their own right to self-determination. Internal issues because of ethnicity or religion would be virtually non-existent. Unequal population growth of one group would not lead to a demographic crisis.|The status of Jerusalem becomes a hard issue to solve. Skepticism between both parties may rise. Due to population density and demographic location, borders of both nations may be awkward and inconvenient to both parties.|

  
Seeing that both of these solutions are not perfect in their nature and may cause further conflicts into the future, it is now the time for the Israeli Government (Represented by INP President, Teaniee) to introduce a new solution to the century-long conflict.



It is believed that the “Three State Solution” may have a better impact on the peoples that are affected by the conflict in the region. It stands to solve problems of separation of peoples by borders and conflicting interests of the three parties.

[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W6vaQPTDq\_iD9jKWEXBV59GzOV1GYSCVikXRUCz4puw/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W6vaQPTDq_iD9jKWEXBV59GzOV1GYSCVikXRUCz4puw/edit?usp=sharing) I wanted to know what both Palestinians and their supporters think, as well as Israelis, the diaspora and the Pro-Israelis think of this, it's a bit boring but I had a lot of fun making it lol, though I made this before June 13th, so it may have some weird out-of-date terms/articles. In accordance with the rules and the character count, I'll put in the preamble here; **Preamble;** Within the solutions of the Israel-Palestine Conflict, many have put forward two main solutions, deemed; “The Two State Solution”, which prefers both an Israeli state and a Palestinian State, and “The One State Solution”, which prefers one single, preferably secular state containing both the Arabs and Jewish in the region. Within the Middle East Region, the Jews and the Arabs have been fighting over the Holy Land throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. Despite these many conflicts, the Israeli government has been adamant about maintaining peace in the Middle East since the War of 1973. The subject matter is of controversial matter, however we affirm to our best ability that everything proceeding is unbiased, and stated true by multiple sources from both parties. The Israeli Government, has now come forward with a plan of action to solve the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict. Let us start by showing some pros and cons of both solutions; || || |Solution|Pros|Cons| |“One State Solution”|Allows for a single nation to govern the peoples in the region. A single government would be more capable in decisively solving internal issues. Would remove external factors or other would-be actors from interfering in Arab-Jewish issues. Removed borders, allowing for free-movement for both parties within the nation.|Wealth Inequality would be vast as the Educated Jewish Population would economically dominate the nation. The Arab Population may become larger than the Jewish one, whilst being marginalized, creating an extremely divided nation. No side would be happy as the joint-nation would not be “Jewish” or “Palestinian”, compromising both ethnic groups’ right to self-determination.| |“Two State Solution”|Both parties retain their own right to self-determination. Internal issues because of ethnicity or religion would be virtually non-existent. Unequal population growth of one group would not lead to a demographic crisis.|The status of Jerusalem becomes a hard issue to solve. Skepticism between both parties may rise. Due to population density and demographic location, borders of both nations may be awkward and inconvenient to both parties.| Seeing that both of these solutions are not perfect in their nature and may cause further conflicts into the future, it is now the time for the Israeli Government (Represented by INP President, Teaniee) to introduce a new solution to the century-long conflict. It is",the three state solution so as a sort of practice for school ive drafted up my own solution to the israelipalestinian conflict though it isnt a traditional one state or two state solution because i wanted to spice it up a little bit and so ive made a theoretical three state solution following an israeli victory in the gaza war  i wanted to know what both palestinians and their supporters think as well as israelis the diaspora and the proisraelis think of this its a bit boring but i had a lot of fun making it lol though i made this before june th so it may have some weird outofdate termsarticles in accordance with the rules and the character count ill put in the preamble here preamble within the solutions of the israelpalestine conflict many have put forward two main solutions deemed the two state solution which prefers both an israeli state and a palestinian state and the one state solution which prefers one single preferably secular state containing both the arabs and jewish in the region within the middle east region the jews and the arabs have been fighting over the holy land throughout the th and st centuries despite these many conflicts the israeli government has been adamant about maintaining peace in the middle east since the war of  the subject matter is of controversial matter however we affirm to our best ability that everything proceeding is unbiased and stated true by multiple sources from both parties the israeli government has now come forward with a plan of action to solve the israelipalestinian conflict let us start by showing some pros and cons of both solutions   solutionproscons one state solutionallows for a single nation to govern the peoples in the region a single government would be more capable in decisively solving internal issues would remove external factors or other wouldbe actors from interfering in arabjewish issues removed borders allowing for freemovement for both parties within the nationwealth inequality would be vast as the educated jewish population would economically dominate the nation the arab population may become larger than the jewish one whilst being marginalized creating an extremely divided nation no side would be happy as the jointnation would not be jewish or palestinian compromising both ethnic groups right to selfdetermination two state solutionboth parties retain their own right to selfdetermination internal issues because of ethnicity or religion would be virtually nonexistent unequal population growth of one group would not lead to a demographic crisisthe status of jerusalem becomes a hard issue to solve skepticism between both parties may rise due to population density and demographic location borders of both nations may be awkward and inconvenient to both parties seeing that both of these solutions are not perfect in their nature and may cause further conflicts into the future it is now the time for the israeli government represented by inp president teaniee to introduce a new solution to the centurylong conflict it is,state solution sort practice school draft solution israelipalestinian conflict traditional state state solution want spice little bit theoretical state solution follow israeli victory gaza war want know palestinians supporter think israelis diaspora proisraelis think bit boring lot fun make lol june weird outofdate termsarticle accordance rule character count ill preamble preamble solution israelpalestine conflict forward main solution deem state solution prefer israeli state palestinian state state solution prefer single preferably secular state contain arabs jewish region middle east region jews arab fight holy land century despite conflict israeli government adamant maintain peace middle east war subject matter controversial matter affirm good ability proceeding unbiased state true multiple source party israeli government come forward plan action solve israelipalestinian conflict let start show pro con solution solutionproscon state solutionallow single nation govern people region single government capable decisively solve internal issue remove external factor wouldbe actor interfere arabjewish issue remove border allow freemovement party nationwealth inequality vast educate jewish population economically dominate nation arab population large jewish whilst marginalize create extremely divided nation happy jointnation jewish palestinian compromise ethnic group right selfdetermination state solutionboth party retain right selfdetermination internal issue ethnicity religion virtually nonexistent unequal population growth group lead demographic crisisthe status jerusalem hard issue solve skepticism party rise population density demographic location border nation awkward inconvenient party see solution perfect nature cause conflict future time israeli government represent inp president teaniee introduce new solution centurylong conflict
2025-06-22 14:27:03,"People who are in defense of Iran, please explain.","NGL this sounds like a conspiracy theory ""Every evil thing came from Zionist 9/11 Zionist, the 2008 global economy crash was the Zionist! My house losing power.. why it must be the Zionist!""","I genuinely want to hear your complete opinion from A to Z so I can understand because as someone who feels differently on this topic, it's hard for me to understand your position. I have a pretty nuanced position on the greater conflict here. I'm not strictly on one side or the other.

To try to simplify/summarize my position: I think what Israel is doing in Gaza is wrong. I think Israel had a right to defend itself, to return its hostages home, but the approach it chose was morally wrong and also strategically wrong due to the reputational damage it caused. I don't think Israel should have been founded 80 years ago - This was a great mistake on the part of the West, but it is not a mistake that should be undone. It is useless to consider rectifying it now. The important thing is what course of action should be taken going forward. As someone who lives in the west and believes in western values, I believe that Israel should continue to exist going forward, and that Israel existing is better than the alternative. In a perfect world, I would like to see a two state solution, but I don't think this is realistic. Both israelis and palestinians do not want this. You can't force a solution on two parties that neither party agrees to.

Moving onto Iran - I feel that many western people sympathize with Iran purely as an extension of their distaste for whats happening in Gaza, which makes very little sense to me.

I have a very pragmatic way of thinking about this situation, and this makes it hard for me to understand why these people feel the way they do. I guess that I would like to hear what the proposed solution is for people on the other side of this issue? Should all jews be removed from Israel and sent back to Europe/elsewhere, and should Iran be left to its own devices? Do you presume that Iran is a benevolent actor or that by removing all jews from Israel, Iran would stop there and would become a peaceful and positive partner to western nations?

From my view, Iran is a theocracy, and its leadership fundamentally despises Israel, the US, and the west as a whole. If you value the continuity and success of western society, Iran is at best an instigator, and at worst an enemy. While the people of Iran don't necessarily embody these ideals, the leadership clearly does. I think that it is clear that Iran at a minimum wants to use nuclear development as leverage to exort the west. It is at minimum a bargaining chip that can be abused to get concessions from the west. The more pessimistic view is that Iran would like to become a nuclear armed state. I am pessimistic here. Nuclear capability coupled with Iran's missiles program would give it enormous leverage over the west, similar to the leverage North Korea has, but even greater. I think it is naive to believe that this is not the case, and that Iran is some peaceful nation with a nuclear power program, and no goals of weaponization, simply being propagandized and mischaracterized by the West.

I don't know that there is an easy solution here - wars in the middle east don't tend to be very fruitful over the long term. I think that the current course of action has been appropriate. Bombing and dismantling Iran's nuclear program and killing its leadership is a net positive for the West. A nuclear armed Iran is incredibly problematic for anyone with western values in my opinion, and again, thinking that Iran is not trying to achieve that goal is incredibly naive.

Would love to hear different perspectives here so I can understand the reasoning of people who feel differently. I want to understand what you would like to happen in this region, and why you believe this is a better future for humanity or in line with your values, and please consider the long term implications of different courses of action.",1,BlatanBread,"People who are in defense of Iran, please explain.

2025-06-24 17:44:10,Why did Israeli officials call IDF rapists “heroes”?,Guards said that the shields were to protect themselves from thrown objects.,"A few weeks ago a leaked CCTV clip showed Israeli reservists brutally gang-raping a bound Palestinian detainee inside the Sde Teiman military detention camp. The video triggered a military police investigation and the detention of several soldiers for questioning.

Instead of condemning the abuse, far-right activists and some elected officials rushed to defend those soldiers as “heroes.” In late July dozens of masked protesters stormed the Sde Teiman base and then the Beit Lid facility, clashing with military police and demanding the immediate release of the accused. They carried Israeli flags, chanted that the arrests were a betrayal of the IDF, and tried to block the legal process.

Several high-ranking ministers even took to social media. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich posted on X that Israel’s “heroic warriors” must be protected and insisted the probe was a witch-hunt against the army. Transportation Minister Miri Regev warned in her tweet that prosecuting soldiers mid-war was “dangerous” and only served to appease Israel’s enemies. Economy Minister Nir Barkat also tweeted support, calling on officials to back the fighters rather than punish them.


The man in question did not participate in the October 7th attacks, and was not among the Nukhba forces. … Contrary to what was claimed, he was not a commander in Hamas… but rather lived in the Jabaliya refugee camp.￼

Most people there have not been trialed or confirmed to be Hamas members, some are doctors and aid workers.

The military referred to him at first as a “suspected Hamas fighter,” even claiming he was from the elite Nukhba unit  ￼.
	
Later investigations found no record of him being charged or formally linked to Hamas .
	
According to leaked court documents and reporting, he was most likely a low-level security officer from Jabalia, not a combatant. He hadn’t been arrested on October 7, only in March—and detainees like him are often held without transparent charges

2025-06-22 14:27:03,"People who are in defense of Iran, please explain.","The word I would disagree with in your comment is secretly.


It's very open and obvious at this point. It's just become normalized and another dead 30 or 40 Palestinians is barely worth noticing round the world.


A third page story in the kind of papers read by people who already think Israel are the bad guys. ","I genuinely want to hear your complete opinion from A to Z so I can understand because as someone who feels differently on this topic, it's hard for me to understand your position. I have a pretty nuanced position on the greater conflict here. I'm not strictly on one side or the other.

To try to simplify/summarize my position: I think what Israel is doing in Gaza is wrong. I think Israel had a right to defend itself, to return its hostages home, but the approach it chose was morally wrong and also strategically wrong due to the reputational damage it caused. I don't think Israel should have been founded 80 years ago - This was a great mistake on the part of the West, but it is not a mistake that should be undone. It is useless to consider rectifying it now. The important thing is what course of action should be taken going forward. As someone who lives in the west and believes in western values, I believe that Israel should continue to exist going forward, and that Israel existing is better than the alternative. In a perfect world, I would like to see a two state solution, but I don't think this is realistic. Both israelis and palestinians do not want this. You can't force a solution on two parties that neither party agrees to.

Moving onto Iran - I feel that many western people sympathize with Iran purely as an extension of their distaste for whats happening in Gaza, which makes very little sense to me.

I have a very pragmatic way of thinking about this situation, and this makes it hard for me to understand why these people feel the way they do. I guess that I would like to hear what the proposed solution is for people on the other side of this issue? Should all jews be removed from Israel and sent back to Europe/elsewhere, and should Iran be left to its own devices? Do you presume that Iran is a benevolent actor or that by removing all jews from Israel, Iran would stop there and would become a peaceful and positive partner to western nations?

From my view, Iran is a theocracy, and its leadership fundamentally despises Israel, the US, and the west as a whole. If you value the continuity and success of western society, Iran is at best an instigator, and at worst an enemy. While the people of Iran don't necessarily embody these ideals, the leadership clearly does. I think that it is clear that Iran at a minimum wants to use nuclear development as leverage to exort the west. It is at minimum a bargaining chip that can be abused to get concessions from the west. The more pessimistic view is that Iran would like to become a nuclear armed state. I am pessimistic here. Nuclear capability coupled with Iran's missiles program would give it enormous leverage over the west, similar to the leverage North Korea has, but even greater. I think it is naive to believe that this is not the case, and that Iran is some peaceful nation with a nuclear power program, and no goals of weaponization, simply being propagandized and mischaracterized by the West.

I don't know that there is an easy solution here - wars in the middle east don't tend to be very fruitful over the long term. I think that the current course of action has been appropriate. Bombing and dismantling Iran's nuclear program and killing its leadership is a net positive for the West. A nuclear armed Iran is incredibly problematic for anyone with western values in my opinion, and again, thinking that Iran is not trying to achieve that goal is incredibly naive.

Would love to hear different perspectives here so I can understand the reasoning of people who feel differently. I want to understand what you would like to happen in this region, and why you believe this is a better future for humanity or in line with your values, and please consider the long term implications of different courses of action.",1,Hungry-Western9191,"People who are in defense of Iran, please explain.

2025-06-24 16:34:42,The Three State Solution,"Hey thanks for actually reading through the document, your criticism is really useful for my future development! 

  
A) I felt that it was necessary for Israel to provide reparations for multiple reasons, as well as seeing it unfeasible for Gaza to actually send reparations to Israel. 

1. The reconstruction of Gaza 

2. Reparations to families who have lost family members who weren't combatants

3. Continued economic suppression/obstructions to the Gazan economy will result in the population not being any better off than they were before the war, likely even in a worse position considering the civilian infrastructure and such that has been destroyed in the war. 

This may lead to continued civil unrest and an eventual radical government being put into place once again, repeating the whole affair (I looked at Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Palestine in 2006 as an example of this)

4. Although it is true that Gaza started the war, they are just in no position whatsoever to actually pay any reparations. Not to mention the humiliation of the Gazan people if they were forced to pay reparations. I was intentionally trying to avoid a Treaty of Versailles situation.



B) Yes, sorry I forgot to mention who would enforce the demilitarization, though I'd assume, the United Nations Security Council, the United States, and the Arab League would keep them in check. If not, then likely some of the observers of the treaty.



C) Again, a mistake I've made, I'd hope that possibly the ICJ or an investigation by the Republic of Gaza/Palestine may be able to make a ruling on what exactly happened in a situation like that. Without clear evidence that can prove the government's explicit support and or execution of it, a ""casus beli"" wouldn't be able to be reached, thus stopping a justification of retaliation by Israel. 

  
If for an example, an unaffiliated terrorist group or otherwise an armed group committed the act, they'd just be treated like any other insurgency or terrorist group, considering the Demilitarization of Gaza, they'd likely ask either Egypt or Israel to send counter insurgency forces.

  
D) This is really embarrassing actually, I think I meant to say ""Israel isn't allowed to Pre-Emptively strike without evidence/reason"", I'm not sure what I was doing when I was writing that. 

  
E) I'm not sure why this is needed exactly? Palestinians are likely able to return both to the Republic of Palestine or Gaza, why aren't Jews allowed to have the same right to Israel?","So as a sort of ""practice"" for school, I've drafted up my own 'solution' to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict, though it isn't a traditional one state or two state solution because I wanted to spice it up a little bit, and so I've made a theoretical three state solution following an Israeli victory in the Gaza War.

[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W6vaQPTDq\_iD9jKWEXBV59GzOV1GYSCVikXRUCz4puw/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W6vaQPTDq_iD9jKWEXBV59GzOV1GYSCVikXRUCz4puw/edit?usp=sharing)

I wanted to know what both Palestinians and their supporters think, as well as Israelis, the diaspora and the Pro-Israelis think of this, it's a bit boring but I had a lot of fun making it lol, though I made this before June 13th, so it may have some weird out-of-date terms/articles.



In accordance with the rules and the character count, I'll put in the preamble here;

  
**Preamble;** 

Within the solutions of the Israel-Palestine Conflict, many have put forward two main solutions, deemed; “The Two State Solution”, which prefers both an Israeli state and a Palestinian State, and “The One State Solution”, which prefers one single, preferably secular state containing both the Arabs and Jewish in the region.



Within the Middle East Region, the Jews and the Arabs have been fighting over the Holy Land throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. Despite these many conflicts, the Israeli government has been adamant about maintaining peace in the Middle East since the War of 1973.



The subject matter is of controversial matter, however we affirm to our best ability that everything proceeding is unbiased, and stated true by multiple sources from both parties.



The Israeli Government, has now come forward with a plan of action to solve the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict.



Let us start by showing some pros and cons of both solutions;

||
||
|Solution|Pros|Cons|
|“One State Solution”|Allows for a single nation to govern the peoples in the region. A single government would be more capable in decisively solving internal issues. Would remove external factors or other would-be actors from interfering in Arab-Jewish issues. Removed borders, allowing for free-movement for both parties within the nation.|Wealth Inequality would be vast as the Educated Jewish Population would economically dominate the nation. The Arab Population may become larger than the Jewish one, whilst being marginalized, creating an extremely divided nation. No side would be happy as the joint-nation would not be “Jewish” or “Palestinian”, compromising both ethnic groups’ right to self-determination.|
|“Two State Solution”|Both parties retain their own right to self-determination. Internal issues because of ethnicity or religion would be virtually non-existent. Unequal population growth of one group would not lead to a demographic crisis.|The status of Jerusalem becomes a hard issue to solve. Skepticism between both parties may rise. Due to population density and demographic location, borders of both nations may be awkward and inconvenient to both parties.|

  
Seeing that both of these solutions are not perfect in their nature and may cause further conflicts into the future, it is now the time for the Israeli Government (Represented by INP President, Teaniee) to introduce a new solution to the century-long conflict.



It is believed that the “Three State Solution” may have a better impact on the peoples that are affected by the conflict in the region. It stands to solve problems of separation of peoples by borders and conflicting interests of the three parties.

2025-06-23 13:12:29,This subreddit has a clear pro-Israeli bias,"The point is that it’s hypocritical. Israel doesn’t want to recognize Palestine as a state, yet they cry about their right to exist and cause a big scene at the slightest conflict with their neighbors, begging the US to support them with their tyrannical goals. If you want people to acknowledge your right to exist, how about acknowledging their existence and right to self determination as well.","If you’ve spent any real time on r/IsraelPalestine, it becomes painfully obvious that the subreddit isn’t actually a neutral space for discussion, it’s a curated stage for a very particular narrative: one that consistently bends toward excusing Zionism, obscuring Palestinian resistance, and laundering Israeli state violence through the language of security, diplomacy, and ""peace.""

At the heart of this is a deep, unspoken bias: Zionism is normalized, even celebrated, while any organized Palestinian or regional response to Zionism is pathologized. The state of Israel, founded through mass displacement and continued military domination, is treated as a given, a nation with existential needs, security concerns, and legitimacy. But when Palestinians resist, whether violently, politically, or through civil disobedience it’s always framed as extremism, terrorism, or refusal to compromise. This framing is not accidental. It’s baked into the logic of the subreddit itself: what kind of speech is upvoted, which voices are platformed, and what types of suffering are seen as “context” rather than central facts.

One of the most frustrating dynamics is the subreddit’s liberal Zionist consensus, a worldview that claims to oppose occupation, but only in theory, only if it doesn’t involve seriously interrogating Jewish supremacy as embedded in Israeli law and policy. These users cling to the fantasy of a “two-state solution” long after even Israeli leaders have discarded it. They offer words of peace, but only if Palestinians accept fragmentation, limited autonomy, and no meaningful return. They’ll express sadness over bombings in Gaza but still frame every war as something “Hamas started.”

What this group often refuses to understand is how, for many Palestinians, and for a surprising number of secular Arabs and Iranians too, groups like Hamas or the IRGC aren't just caricatures of Islamist authoritarianism. They’re seen as responses to something even more suffocating: occupation, siege, bombardment, and decades of Western-backed dispossession. You don’t have to agree with these groups’ ideologies to understand why people who have watched Israeli bombs level their cities, or who live under constant threat of regime change (Reza Pahlavi, the disgraced son of their former corrupt monarch is literally being floated as one of the more likely successors to the regime by the Israeli government) , might view them as defense, as dignity, as something, when the world offers them nothing.

This is especially true in moments of Israeli escalation. When Israeli warplanes flatten residential towers in Gaza, when Israeli politicians openly speak about wiping out “human animals,” when sanctions suffocate Iranian hospitals while foreign powers openly call for “regime change” in Tehran or Damascus—it should be no surprise that even secular citizens, people who might oppose clericalism or militant rhetoric in other contexts, find themselves aligning with resistance factions. Because when your options are annihilation or flawed resistance, survival usually doesn’t ask for ideological purity.

Take, for example, the **r**ecent US airstrike of Iran's nuclear facilities, an act of aggression that, like Israeli airstrikes on Gaza, was framed as a **necessary measure of security**. But in what right does Israel, or the U.S., for that matter have to dictate whether Iran can or cannot pursue nuclear weapons? The logic used to justify these actions is essentially the same logic that’s used to frame **Israeli occupation** and **bombing campaigns** in Palestine: it's about **defending the West** and **securing regional stability**, even if that means **extending occupation** and **worsening humanitarian crises**.

What is often left out of the equation is that the U.S. and Israel have **repeatedly been the aggressors** in the region. **Israel’s nuclear weapons program** is not only **unacknowledged** by the international community but also **never subject to the same scrutiny** Iran faces, even though Israel maintains **a significant nuclear arsenal** and has used its military to **target neighboring countries**. The **U.S.** is equally guilty of such hypocrisy. For decades, it has **interfered in the region**—whether through direct military intervention or by supporting **authoritarian regimes** that maintain order at the expense of the people.

And yet, when it comes to Iran seeking nuclear capabilities, both the U.S. and Israel cast themselves as the **global arbiters of what is and isn’t acceptable** in terms of weapons development. **The double standard is glaring**. While these powers have **militarized the region**, **propped up despotic regimes**, and **launched devastating airstrikes**, they’re now positioning themselves as the defenders of peace and stability, telling Iran what it can and cannot do. It’s like a thief telling a neighbor not to lock their door while they’ve been robbing houses down the street for years.

This is part of a larger Western imperial project that the subreddit often fails to interrogate. When the U.S. bombs Iran, imposes crippling sanctions on its population, and supports the Israeli military’s daily violence, it’s framed as an exceptional and justified act, necessary for peace and security, despite the fact that these same actions destabilize entire countries and perpetuate cycles of violence. Yet, when Palestinians push back, whether through armed resistance or nonviolent protests, the rhetoric shifts to terrorism and rejectionism.

But here's where the real distortion occurs on r/IsraelPalestine: the reduction of Israeli violence to Netanyahu’s policies. This narrative seeks to isolate the problem to one individual—Benjamin Netanyahu—while glossing over the larger, deeply embedded support for Zionism and Israel's policies within Israeli society. Netanyahu is not the sole actor in this; he represents a wider consensus among many Israelis who actively support the policies of military occupation, apartheid, and ethnic cleansing. This isn't just the rhetoric of one government official—it’s the reality of Israeli state policy, supported by a large section of the Israeli public. To keep framing the issue as simply Netanyahu’s fault is to ignore the structural violence of a state that has existed for over seven decades with its policies largely supported by the Israeli electorate.

Further, a lot of Israelis here (especially ""peaceniks"") regurgitate the narrative that Palestinian citizens of Israel (those who remained after the 1948 Nakba) are somehow the “proof” that Israel isn’t an apartheid state is deeply misleading. The fact that Palestinians living in Israel are used as a cover, a shield to deflect accusations of apartheid, is a hilarious obfuscation of reality. These Palestinians, while technically citizens, remain second-class citizens with no real equality in housing, education, land access, political power, or resources. They live under discriminatory laws that prevent them from accessing many of the same opportunities as Jewish Israelis. They are subject to surveillance, systemic oppression, and are often treated as suspect citizens in their own homeland, particularly when they protest or speak out for Palestinian rights. Claiming that Israel isn't an apartheid state because of this minority group’s legal status ignores the profound inequalities that exist, and, frankly, smacks of a deliberate attempt to shield Israel from valid international criticism.

And yet, on r/IsraelPalestine, this complexity is erased. People speak of “terrorism” without asking what produced it. They invoke atrocities without acknowledging the structures that created the desperation behind them. And they constantly weaponize Jewish historical trauma as a shield for contemporary colonial policy, shutting down critique by collapsing Zionism with Judaism in ways that silence even anti-Zionist Jews.

Let’s be clear: the subreddit does not treat history with any kind of balance. The Nakba is a footnote; the Sabra and Shatila massacre is ignored; the siege of Gaza is abstracted into rocket statistics. But bring up any act of resistance, and the moral clarity becomes blinding. “They started it.” “They rejected peace.” “They hate Jews.” The same users who will tell you the occupation is “complex” and “multifaceted” will reduce the entire Palestinian national movement to antisemitism or religious fanaticism.

And beyond Palestinians, there’s a consistent erasure of how Israeli policy has brutalized the broader region—bombings in Syria and Lebanon, assassinations in Iran, the destabilization of Egypt, and the indirect role Israel played in supporting authoritarian regimes favorable to Western policy. When people from these countries raise grievances, the response is always the same: whataboutism, deflection, and an insistence that any suffering caused by Israel is either exaggerated or deserved.

The underlying message is clear: some lives require context, others are just collateral.

If r/IsraelPalestine wanted to be a genuine forum for difficult, uncomfortable conversations, it would have to do much more than ban slurs and lock threads. It would have to question its own foundations: why Zionism is treated as a legitimate national movement, while Palestinian nationalism is treated as a pathology. Why liberal Zionist fantasies of peace are treated as pragmatism, while Palestinian demands for equality and return are labeled as rejectionism. Why those resisting a siege are constantly asked to justify themselves, while the siege itself is accepted as the natural order of things.

Until that happens, r/IsraelPalestine isn’t a discussion space. It’s just a digital checkpoint—policing what kinds of grief are legitimate, and what kinds of resistance are allowed to exist. I am sure this will get downvoted to oblivion but if you're still a Zionist in the big 25' I doubt anything I say could change your mind",1,financeposter,"This subreddit has a clear pro-Israeli bias If you’ve spent any real time on r/IsraelPalestine, it becomes painfully obvious that the subreddit isn’t actually a neutral space for discussion, it’s a curated stage for a very particular narrative: one that consistently bends toward excusing Zionism, obscuring Palestinian resistance, and laundering Israeli state violence through the language of security, diplomacy, and ""peace."" At the heart of this is a deep, unspoken bias: Zionism is normalized, even celebrated, while any organized Palestinian or regional response to Zionism is pathologized. The state of Israel, founded through mass displacement and continued military domination, is treated as a given, a nation with existential needs, security concerns, and legitimacy. But when Palestinians resist, whether violently, politically, or through civil disobedience it’s always framed as extremism, terrorism, or refusal to compromise. This framing is not accidental. It’s baked into the logic of the subreddit itself: what kind of speech is upvoted, which voices are platformed, and what types of suffering are seen as “context” rather than central facts. One of the most frustrating dynamics is the subreddit’s liberal Zionist consensus, a worldview that claims to oppose occupation, but only in theory, only if it doesn’t involve seriously interrogating Jewish supremacy as embedded in Israeli law and policy. These users cling to the fantasy of a “two-state solution” long after even Israeli leaders have discarded it. They offer words of peace, but only if Palestinians accept fragmentation, limited autonomy, and no meaningful return. They’ll express sadness over bombings in Gaza but still frame every war as something “Hamas started.” What this group often refuses to understand is how, for many Palestinians, and for a surprising number of secular Arabs and Iranians too, groups like Hamas or the IRGC aren't just caricatures of Islamist authoritarianism. They’re seen as responses to something even more suffocating: occupation, siege, bombardment, and decades of Western-backed dispossession. You don’t have to agree with these groups’ ideologies to understand why people who have watched Israeli bombs level their cities, or who live under constant threat of regime change (Reza Pahlavi, the disgraced son of their former corrupt monarch is literally being floated as one of the more likely successors to the regime by the Israeli government) , might view them as defense, as dignity, as something, when the world offers them nothing. This is especially true in moments of Israeli escalation. When Israeli warplanes flatten residential towers in Gaza, when Israeli politicians openly speak about wiping out “human animals,” when sanctions suffocate Iranian hospitals while foreign powers openly call for “regime change” in Tehran or Damascus—it should be no surprise that even secular citizens, people who might oppose clericalism or militant rhetoric in other contexts, find themselves aligning with resistance factions. Because when your options are annihilation or flawed resistance, survival usually doesn’t ask for ideological purity.

2025-06-23 04:55:30,The Palestinian Charade: A manufactured people for a political agenda,"u/No-Literature-9387 you’re doing exactly what you accuse others of. Rewriting history to fit a convenient political narrative.

Let’s be clear again, no one said Jews aren’t indigenous to the region. What’s being rejected is the idea that modern political Zionism which involved mass displacement and military conquest automatically justifies the continued subjugation of another indigenous population. The two historical truths can coexist: that Jews have deep roots in the land, and so do Palestinians.

Your attempt to reduce Palestinian identity to nothing more than “opposition to Israel” is not only factually lazy like many other similar arguments, it’s dehumanizing. National movements don't emerge fully formed from divine revelation, they evolve in response to historical trauma, foreign rule, and geopolitical shifts. It's just reality. Like I said that’s true of the U.S. in the 1770s, of Italy in the 1860s, of Israel in 1948, and of Palestine across the 20th century. Pretending Palestinians don’t exist unless they fit your idea of a ‘worthy’ nationalism is pure bad faith.

Then the issue of invoking a 2000-year-old book to justify modern displacement and bombardment? If Hamas quoted scripture to flatten a Tel Aviv suburb, you'd rightly call it terrorism, not theology. So we can't just pretend that ancient kingdoms confer modern impunity.

You say resistance “isn’t working.” That assumes that silence and surrender are somehow better options under siege and occupation, and I'm not talking about Hamas's abhorrent attacks against civilians, but resistance against occupation. Maybe instead of lecturing Palestinians on how they should endure persecution and subjugation more quietly, try asking why Israel, which again is a nuclear-armed state with an incredible modern army, still insists on denying millions of people basic rights, movement, and dignity. This is not self-defense, it is structural violence.

This isn’t about taking sides between identities, it’s about recognizing that peace can’t be built on denial and domination. If your only version of peace is one where Palestinians disappear politically or physically you’re not making an argument, you’re justifying injustice and violence.","Let's be real: the idea of a ""Palestinian people"" isn't some ancient truth. It's a story cooked up and used as a weapon by Arab and Islamist groups to bash Israel. Nobody was clamoring for a ""Palestinian State"" back in the day.

Think about it. After the 1948 war, did the Arab nations jump to create a Palestinian homeland? Nope. Jordan just grabbed the West Bank, and Egypt took over Gaza. They weren't fighting for ""Palestine""; they were fighting for more land for themselves. The ""All-Palestine Government"" set up in Gaza was a joke, a puppet on Egypt's strings. It was about taking territory, not setting up a new country.

This whole ""Palestinian identity"" really kicked into high gear after 1967, when Israel ended up with land those Arab nations used to control. Suddenly, after failing to wipe Israel off the map in a straight-up fight, the game changed. The ""stateless Palestinian"" became the perfect prop, a sob story to parade around the world to make Israel look bad. It was a slick move: shift from trying to destroy a country to claiming to fight for a ""native people's"" freedom.

This made-up identity has one clear goal: to make Israel illegitimate. Why admit Jews have ancient ties to the land when you can claim a long, unbroken Palestinian history that just happened to pop up in the late 20th century? These folks weren't ""Palestinians"" before; they were Arabs living in a region, often seeing themselves as part of Syria or just a bigger Arab world.

The ""Palestinian people"" is a political invention, a tool for those who want to wipe Israel off the map under the banner of ""liberation."" The world has mostly fallen for it, ignoring what actually happened and buying into a story designed for endless conflict, not real peace.

This is especially true in moments of Israeli escalation. When Israeli warplanes flatten residential towers in Gaza, when Israeli politicians openly speak about wiping out “human animals,” when sanctions suffocate Iranian hospitals while foreign powers openly call for “regime change” in Tehran or Damascus—it should be no surprise that even secular citizens, people who might oppose clericalism or militant rhetoric in other contexts, find themselves aligning with resistance factions. Because when your options are annihilation or flawed resistance, survival usually doesn’t ask for ideological purity.

Take, for example, the **r**ecent US airstrike of Iran's nuclear facilities, an act of aggression that, like Israeli airstrikes on Gaza, was framed as a **necessary measure of security**. But in what right does Israel, or the U.S., for that matter have to dictate whether Iran can or cannot pursue nuclear weapons? The logic used to justify these actions is essentially the same logic that’s used to frame **Israeli occupation** and **bombing campaigns** in Palestine: it's about **defending the West** and **securing regional stability**, even if that means **extending occupation** and **worsening humanitarian crises**.

What is often left out of the equation is that the U.S. and Israel have **repeatedly been the aggressors** in the region. **Israel’s nuclear weapons program** is not only **unacknowledged** by the international community but also **never subject to the same scrutiny** Iran faces, even though Israel maintains **a significant nuclear arsenal** and has used its military to **target neighboring countries**. The **U.S.** is equally guilty of such hypocrisy. For decades, it has **interfered in the region**—whether through direct military intervention or by supporting **authoritarian regimes** that maintain order at the expense of the people.

And yet, when it comes to Iran seeking nuclear capabilities, both the U.S. and Israel cast themselves as the **global arbiters of what is and isn’t acceptable** in terms of weapons development. **The double standard is glaring**. While these powers have **militarized the region**, **propped up despotic regimes**, and **launched devastating airstrikes**, they’re now positioning themselves as the defenders of peace and stability, telling Iran what it can and cannot do. It’s like a thief telling a neighbor not to lock their door while they’ve been robbing houses down the street for years.

This is part of a larger Western imperial project that the subreddit often fails to interrogate. When the U.S. bombs Iran, imposes crippling sanctions on its population, and supports the Israeli military’s daily violence, it’s framed as an exceptional and justified act, necessary for peace and security, despite the fact that these same actions destabilize entire countries and perpetuate cycles of violence. Yet, when Palestinians push back, whether through armed resistance or nonviolent protests, the rhetoric shifts to terrorism and rejectionism.

But here's where the real distortion occurs on r/IsraelPalestine: the reduction of Israeli violence to Netanyahu’s policies. This narrative seeks to isolate the problem to one individual—Benjamin Netanyahu—while glossing over the larger, deeply embedded support for Zionism and Israel's policies within Israeli society. Netanyahu is not the sole actor in this; he represents a wider consensus among many Israelis who actively support the policies of military occupation, apartheid, and ethnic cleansing. This isn't just the rhetoric of one government official—it’s the reality of Israeli state policy, supported by a large section of the Israeli public. To keep framing the issue as simply Netanyahu’s fault is to ignore the structural violence of a state that has existed for over seven decades with its policies largely supported by the Israeli electorate.

Further, a lot of Israelis here (especially ""peaceniks"") regurgitate the narrative that Palestinian citizens of Israel (those who remained after the 1948 Nakba) are somehow the “proof” that Israel isn’t an apartheid state is deeply misleading. The fact that Palestinians living in Israel are used as a cover, a shield to deflect accusations of apartheid, is a hilarious obfuscation of reality. These Palestinians, while technically citizens, remain second-class citizens with no real equality in housing, education, land access, political power, or resources. They live under discriminatory laws that prevent them from accessing many of the same opportunities as Jewish Israelis. They are subject to surveillance, systemic oppression, and are often treated as suspect citizens in their own homeland, particularly when they protest or speak out for Palestinian rights. Claiming that Israel isn't an apartheid state because of this minority group’s legal status ignores the profound inequalities that exist, and, frankly, smacks of a deliberate attempt to shield Israel from valid international criticism.

And yet, on r/IsraelPalestine, this complexity is erased. People speak of “terrorism” without asking what produced it. They invoke atrocities without acknowledging the structures that created the desperation behind them. And they constantly weaponize Jewish historical trauma as a shield for contemporary colonial policy, shutting down critique by collapsing Zionism with Judaism in ways that silence even anti-Zionist Jews.

Let’s be clear: the subreddit does not treat history with any kind of balance. The Nakba is a footnote; the Sabra and Shatila massacre is ignored; the siege of Gaza is abstracted into rocket statistics. But bring up any act of resistance, and the moral clarity becomes blinding. “They started it.” “They rejected peace.” “They hate Jews.” The same users who will tell you the occupation is “complex” and “multifaceted” will reduce the entire Palestinian national movement to antisemitism or religious fanaticism.

And beyond Palestinians, there’s a consistent erasure of how Israeli policy has brutalized the broader region—bombings in Syria and Lebanon, assassinations in Iran, the destabilization of Egypt, and the indirect role Israel played in supporting authoritarian regimes favorable to Western policy. When people from these countries raise grievances, the response is always the same: whataboutism, deflection, and an insistence that any suffering caused by Israel is either exaggerated or deserved.

the heart of this is a deep unspoken bias zionism is normalized even celebrated while any organized palestinian or regional response to zionism is pathologized the state of israel founded through mass displacement and continued military domination is treated as a given a nation with existential needs security concerns and legitimacy but when palestinians resist whether violently politically or through civil disobedience its always framed as extremism terrorism or refusal to compromise this framing is not accidental its baked into the logic of the subreddit itself what kind of speech is upvoted which voices are platformed and what types of suffering are seen as context rather than central facts one of the most frustrating dynamics is the subreddits liberal zionist consensus a worldview that claims to oppose occupation but only in theory only if it doesnt involve seriously interrogating jewish supremacy as embedded in israeli law and policy these users cling to the fantasy of a twostate solution long after even israeli leaders have discarded it they offer words of peace but only if palestinians accept fragmentation limited autonomy and no meaningful return theyll express sadness over bombings in gaza but still frame every war as something hamas started what this group often refuses to understand is how for many palestinians and for a surprising number of secular arabs and iranians too groups like hamas or the irgc arent just caricatures of islamist authoritarianism theyre seen as responses to something even more suffocating occupation siege bombardment and decades of westernbacked dispossession you dont have to agree with these groups ideologies to understand why people who have watched israeli bombs level their cities or who live under constant threat of regime change reza pahlavi the disgraced son of their former corrupt monarch is literally being floated as one of the more likely successors to the regime by the israeli government  might view them as defense as dignity as something when the world offers them nothing this is especially true in moments of israeli escalation when israeli warplanes flatten residential towers in gaza when israeli politicians openly speak about wiping out human animals when sanctions suffocate iranian hospitals while foreign powers openly call for regime change in tehran or damascusit should be no surprise that even secular citizens people who might oppose clericalism or militant rhetoric in other contexts find themselves aligning with resistance factions because when your options are annihilation or flawed resistance survival usually doesnt ask for ideological purity take for example the recent us airstrike of irans nuclear facilities an act of aggression that like israeli

2025-06-24 13:19:13,Imagine With Me for One Second…,I guess that depends on on which side of the hotel wall you’re on,"It’s 10/8 here in the US. I wake up, I see first thing on IG (which I still had back then), “Netanyahu declares total war.” My instinct is to roll my eyes because clearly there’s been more rocket attacks and he’s using dramatic language for what essentially amounts to the old “mowing the lawn.” *We’ve been here before* I think, annoyed at this setback to the peace process that groups like Standing Together, Abraham Tours, The Parents Circle, Women Wage Peace, and so many others have been working on together for decades.  
  
Then, I see the footage that HAMAS filmed themselves in the kibbutzim. I see the carnage, the depravity, the kidnapping of Noa Argamani, the family held hostage in their home by Hamasniks with rifles, children in pools of their parents’ blood. I see all this, because HAMAS filmed themselves doing it, uploaded it. They were proud of this slaughter.  
  
Then next, I see the Times Square demonstration. Here's where I want to engage your imagination. Let’s imagine together what *could* have happened and maybe *should* have happened in the West.

Maybe these organizers say something like, “What happened yesterday does not reflect our movement. We believe in resistance but there is a line, and yesterday that line was crossed. We urge the international community to intervene on behalf of Gazan civilians so that they don’t become collateral in this war that HAMAS has provoked.” Or you know, something along those lines.  
  
Maybe we see banners saying, “**Peace now, justice now, for Palestine and Israel!”** or “**Two peoples, one land, one future for us all.”** (I don’t know, maybe y’all could have come up with something better, this is just what I could find on Google.)  
  
Maybe we see the International Community take responsibility for the role it played in allowing 10/7 to play out. Instead of condemning the response before it even begins (remember, we’re talking 10/8 here) or saying that Israel brought this on itself, maybe the International Community agrees that regardless of preceding events, some things are objectively wrong and must be condemned, and that the UN will do its part in advocating for the hostages’ release, as well as mitigating collateral damage against Gazan civilians (possibly through an evacuation).

  
Maybe the Red Cross *insists* on being allowed to see the hostages, instead of sitting on its hands the entire time. Maybe the Red Cross could say something like, “We acknowledge that we allowed Jewish suffering during the Shoah, that we were more than complicit, that we actively participated in its cover-up, and we want to rectify that today by demanding the immediate and unconditional release of all Israeli hostages presently held in Gaza” or something to that effect.  
  
I just want us to imagine, for one moment, a world that practices moral consistency, rather than the world we live in. Maybe if we can imagine it, we can start to make it real.",1,Notachance326426,"Imagine With Me for One Second… It’s 10/8 here in the US.

2025-06-22 14:27:03,"People who are in defense of Iran, please explain.","Since when did the UN's word become credible? You always complain when the UN says something Pro Israel but then quote it when they say something against it? The UN human rights decision was once chaired by Iran, think about that for a moment. Besides even then they declared the West Bank as the occupation not Gaza which has been free to self rule since 2005","I genuinely want to hear your complete opinion from A to Z so I can understand because as someone who feels differently on this topic, it's hard for me to understand your position. I have a pretty nuanced position on the greater conflict here. I'm not strictly on one side or the other.

To try to simplify/summarize my position: I think what Israel is doing in Gaza is wrong. I think Israel had a right to defend itself, to return its hostages home, but the approach it chose was morally wrong and also strategically wrong due to the reputational damage it caused. I don't think Israel should have been founded 80 years ago - This was a great mistake on the part of the West, but it is not a mistake that should be undone. It is useless to consider rectifying it now. The important thing is what course of action should be taken going forward. As someone who lives in the west and believes in western values, I believe that Israel should continue to exist going forward, and that Israel existing is better than the alternative. In a perfect world, I would like to see a two state solution, but I don't think this is realistic. Both israelis and palestinians do not want this. You can't force a solution on two parties that neither party agrees to.

Moving onto Iran - I feel that many western people sympathize with Iran purely as an extension of their distaste for whats happening in Gaza, which makes very little sense to me.

I have a very pragmatic way of thinking about this situation, and this makes it hard for me to understand why these people feel the way they do. I guess that I would like to hear what the proposed solution is for people on the other side of this issue? Should all jews be removed from Israel and sent back to Europe/elsewhere, and should Iran be left to its own devices? Do you presume that Iran is a benevolent actor or that by removing all jews from Israel, Iran would stop there and would become a peaceful and positive partner to western nations?

From my view, Iran is a theocracy, and its leadership fundamentally despises Israel, the US, and the west as a whole. If you value the continuity and success of western society, Iran is at best an instigator, and at worst an enemy. While the people of Iran don't necessarily embody these ideals, the leadership clearly does. I think that it is clear that Iran at a minimum wants to use nuclear development as leverage to exort the west. It is at minimum a bargaining chip that can be abused to get concessions from the west. The more pessimistic view is that Iran would like to become a nuclear armed state. I am pessimistic here. Nuclear capability coupled with Iran's missiles program would give it enormous leverage over the west, similar to the leverage North Korea has, but even greater. I think it is naive to believe that this is not the case, and that Iran is some peaceful nation with a nuclear power program, and no goals of weaponization, simply being propagandized and mischaracterized by the West.

I don't know that there is an easy solution here - wars in the middle east don't tend to be very fruitful over the long term. I think that the current course of action has been appropriate. Bombing and dismantling Iran's nuclear program and killing its leadership is a net positive for the West. A nuclear armed Iran is incredibly problematic for anyone with western values in my opinion, and again, thinking that Iran is not trying to achieve that goal is incredibly naive.

Would love to hear different perspectives here so I can understand the reasoning of people who feel differently. I want to understand what you would like to happen in this region, and why you believe this is a better future for humanity or in line with your values, and please consider the long term implications of different courses of action.",1,BlatanBread,"People who are in defense of Iran, please explain.
